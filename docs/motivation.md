# Motivation

**DeFi lending is stuck.** To borrow $1,000, you need to lock up $1,500 in collateral. This works for leverage trading, but it fundamentally limits crypto's growth:

- **Can't onboard new people** - They don't have crypto assets to use as collateral
- **Can't fund real economic activity** - Small businesses, equipment purchases, working capital all impossible
- **Can't expand the economy** - Just redistributing existing capital among people who already have it
- **Can't deliver on crypto's promise** - Financial access without banks, but only if you're already wealthy

Meanwhile, 1.7 billion people remain unbanked. Payday lenders charge 300%+ APR. Traditional credit scores exclude billions. And crypto—with all its infrastructure for global, permissionless payments—can't help them.

## Why Uncollateralized Lending Matters

It's how crypto grows beyond speculation into a real economy.

**Economic expansion:** Create new credit, don't just leverage existing assets. Fund businesses, bridge to fiat, enable productive activity.

**User onboarding:** Your friend shares a loan on WhatsApp. Non-crypto people contribute via web. They discover stablecoins, wallets, DeFi—through lending, not trading.

**Crypto's core value proposition:** Global financial access without traditional institutions. We have the payment layer (stablecoins). Now we need the credit layer.

**The infrastructure is ready:** On-chain reputation, social graphs, cashflow oracles, programmable wallets, instant settlement. All the pieces exist to make uncollateralized lending work.

LendFriend is assembling them.
