# Motivation

**DeFi lending is stuck.** To borrow $1,000, you need to lock up $1,500 in collateral. This works for leverage trading, but it fundamentally limits crypto's growth:

- **Can't onboard new people** - No crypto assets = no collateral = no access
- **Can't fund productive activity** - Small businesses, inventory, working capital: all locked out
- **Can't expand the economy** - Just shuffling existing capital among the already-wealthy
- **Can't fulfill crypto's promise** - "Financial access without banks"—but only if you're already rich

Meanwhile, [1.7 billion people remain unbanked](references.md#world-bank-global-findex-2021). Payday lenders charge 300%+ APR. Traditional credit scores exclude billions. And crypto—with all its infrastructure for global, permissionless payments—can't help them.

## Why Uncollateralized Lending Matters

It's how crypto grows beyond speculation into a real economy.

**Economic expansion:** A Shopify merchant borrows $2,000 for inventory, sells it, repays lenders, and everyone grows. That's new economic activity—not just leveraging existing assets for more leverage trades.

**User onboarding:** Someone shares their loan request on social media. Non-crypto people contribute $20 with a credit card. They discover stablecoins, wallets, on-chain settlement—through helping a friend, not trading.

**Crypto's core value proposition:** Global financial access without traditional institutions. We have the payment layer (stablecoins). Now we need the credit layer.

**The infrastructure exists for the first time:** Stablecoins at scale, decentralized social graphs, cashflow APIs, programmable wallets, instant settlement. All the pieces needed to *attempt* crypto-native uncollateralized lending now exist.

LendFriend is assembling them.
