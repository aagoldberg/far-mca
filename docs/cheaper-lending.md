# Why Crypto Lending Can Be Cheaper

Platform lenders like Shopify Capital and Stripe Capital charge 10-50% APR. Not because borrowers are risky—but because traditional financial infrastructure is expensive. Here's the breakdown of where those costs actually go.

---

## The Traditional Lending Cost Structure

When a traditional bank makes a **10% APR loan**, the rate breaks down as follows[[1]](#ref1):

- **5%** — Cost of funds (raising capital)
- **2%** — Operating costs (processing, wages, overhead)
- **2%** — Default risk premium (covering expected losses)
- **1%** — Profit margin

This model works when all four components are low. But for fintech platform lenders serving small businesses, every component is dramatically higher.

## Why Platform Lenders Charge 20-50% APR

Platform lenders like Shopify, Stripe, and PayPal solved cashflow verification—they can see every transaction and accurately assess repayment capacity. But they're constrained by expensive infrastructure.

### High Cost of Capital: 8-10%

Unlike banks with deposit bases, platform lenders rely on:
- **VC equity** demanding 20-30% net IRR[[2]](#ref2)
- **Debt facilities** costing 12-15% all-in[[3]](#ref3)
- Dilution pressure from frequent fundraising rounds

**Result:** 8-10% of APR goes to servicing expensive capital, not covering defaults.

### High Operating Costs: 3-5%

Traditional payment infrastructure adds layers of cost[[4]](#ref4):
- **ACH rails:** $0.10-$0.50 per transaction
- **Settlement delays:** 1-3 business days tie up working capital
- **Reconciliation overhead:** Manual payment tracking and collections
- **Team salaries:** $200K-$500K annually for operations
- **Infrastructure:** $60K-$200K for cloud and compliance systems
- **Launch costs:** $500K-$2.5M for first 12-18 months

**Result:** 3-5% of APR goes to infrastructure overhead, not risk.

### Default Risk Premium: 10-13%

Small business lending does carry real risk. The data:
- **OnDeck** (fintech small business lender): **13.6% net charge-off rate**[[5]](#ref5)
- **Merchant cash advances:** **10-25% default rate** (mid-teens typical)[[6]](#ref6)
- **Fintech small business loans:** 3.53% delinquency rate (vs. 1.77% traditional banks)[[7]](#ref7)

**Result:** 10-13% of APR legitimately covers expected loan losses.

### Profit Margin: 2-5%

Lenders need sustainable margins:
- Financial services industry average: **~10% profit margin**[[8]](#ref8)
- Banks typically achieve: **~25% profit margins**[[9]](#ref9)
- Fintech lenders: **2-5%** after accounting for growth investment

## The Breakdown: 25% APR Platform Loan

For a typical **25% APR small business loan** from a platform lender:

| Component | Percentage | What It Covers |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Cost of Capital** | 8-10% | VC equity (20-30% IRR) + debt facilities (12-15%) |
| **Operating Costs** | 3-5% | ACH rails, settlement delays, staffing, infrastructure |
| **Default Risk Premium** | 10-13% | Covering actual loan losses (13.6% charge-off rate) |
| **Profit Margin** | 2-5% | Sustainable business operations |
| **Total APR** | **23-33%** | Average: ~25% APR |

**Key Insight:** About **11-15 percentage points** (44-60% of the total rate) go to **infrastructure and capital costs**—not covering actual loan losses.

## How Crypto Infrastructure Reduces Costs

Crypto-native lending infrastructure can eliminate most non-risk costs:

### 1. Lower Cost of Capital: Save 8-10%

Instead of VC equity or debt facilities:
- **Stablecoin liquidity pools** with lenders earning market-rate yields (4-8%)
- No dilution pressure or fundraising cycles
- Permissionless global capital access

**Savings:** 8-10 percentage points

### 2. Lower Operating Costs: Save 2-3%

Instead of ACH rails and manual reconciliation:
- **Instant stablecoin settlement** (seconds, not days)
- No working capital tied up in settlement delays
- No ACH transaction fees ($0.10-$0.50 each)
- Programmable smart contract repayments (no manual collections)
- On-chain accounting (automatic reconciliation)

**Savings:** 2-3 percentage points

### 3. Social Trust Reduces Default Risk: Save 1-2%

Adding social accountability to cashflow verification:
- Farcaster social graph creates reputational cost of default
- Borrowers maintain persistent on-chain identity
- Community vouching supplements cashflow data
- Expected: lower default rates than pure cashflow models

**Potential savings:** 1-2 percentage points (requires validation in Phase 0)

---

## The Math: 8-15% APR Instead of 20-50%

Starting from a **25% APR platform loan** (typical for small businesses):

- **Minus 8-10%** (cheaper capital via stablecoin pools)
- **Minus 2-3%** (instant settlement, no ACH fees)
- **Minus 1-2%** (social trust reducing defaults)
- **Plus 2-5%** (maintaining sustainable profit margins)

**Result: 12-17% APR** for similar borrower risk profile

This isn't charity—it's infrastructure arbitrage. Same borrowers, same default risk, different payment rails.

## Why This Works Now

Five years ago, this wasn't possible. Today:

1. **Stablecoins reached $305B supply** with instant settlement[[10]](#ref10)
2. **Social protocols scaled** (Farcaster 1M+ users, Bluesky 20M+ users)[[11]](#ref11)[[12]](#ref12)
3. **Cashflow APIs matured** (Plaid, Square, Shopify verify non-W-2 income)
4. **Smart contracts proven** at scale ($50B+ DeFi TVL)[[13]](#ref13)
5. **Account abstraction** enables programmable payment streams

The infrastructure convergence happened. We're the first to assemble all the pieces for uncollateralized lending.
