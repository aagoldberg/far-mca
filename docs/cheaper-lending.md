# Why Crypto Lending Can Be Cheaper

Platform lenders like Shopify Capital and Stripe Capital charge 10-50% APR. Not because borrowers are risky—but because traditional financial infrastructure is expensive. Here's the breakdown of where those costs actually go.

## How Lending Companies Get Money (And Why It Matters)

Before we dive into costs, let's understand how different lenders raise capital—because this drives a huge portion of APR.

### How Standalone Fintech Lenders Raise Money

**Step 1: Raise VC Equity ($10M)**
- VCs invest $10M, take 25% of the company
- VCs want their $10M to become $100M (10x return in 7 years)
- Company needs to generate HUGE profits to hit this target
- **Result:** Pressure to charge borrowers MORE to achieve VC returns

**Step 2: Get Debt Facility ($50M)**
- Borrow from banks/institutional lenders at 12-15% interest[[3]](#ref3)
- Plus: origination fees (~1%)
- Plus: reserve requirements (need $5M sitting idle for safety)
- Plus: covenants (can't lend to certain borrowers, must maintain ratios)
- **All-in cost: 12-15%**

**Total capital: $60M**
- $10M equity (VCs want 20-30% annual returns)
- $50M debt (costs 12-15%)

**Example loan math:**
```
Lend $1,000 at 25% APR = $250 revenue
- Pay debt interest: 12% × $1,000 = $120
- Pay defaults: 13.6% × $1,000 = $136
- Pay operations: 3% × $1,000 = $30
= Profit: -$36 (losing money!)

Need to charge even MORE to hit VC return targets
```

### How Community Lending Works (LendFriend Model)

**Community lenders put in money directly:**
- Jane puts in $1,000
- Bob puts in $5,000
- 100 people collectively lend $50,000
- They want 8-12% return (normal lending return, not VC-level)
- **No VC equity dilution, no debt facility overhead**

**Example loan math:**
```
Lend $1,000 at 12% APR = $120 revenue
- Pay lenders their yield: 8% × $1,000 = $80
- Pay defaults: 10% × $1,000 = $100 (lower due to social trust)
- Pay operations: 1% × $1,000 = $10 (lower due to crypto infrastructure)
= Profit: -$70

Still tight, but sustainable with scale and lower defaults from social trust
```

### Where The Capital Structure Savings Come From

**1. No VC Dilution Pressure (5-8pp savings)**
- VCs demand 20-30% returns on their equity stake
- P2P lenders happy with 8-12% yields
- Difference: **10-15 percentage points** lower return requirement
- **Savings: 5-8pp** (accounting for their smaller share of capital structure)

**2. No Warehouse Facility Overhead (2-3pp savings)**
- Debt facilities have fees, covenants, reserve requirements
- Direct P2P lending avoids these costs
- **Savings: 2-3pp**

**Important caveat:** When macro interest rates go up (like 2022-2023), even P2P lenders want higher returns:
- If Treasury bonds pay 5%, P2P lenders want 10-13%
- So the advantage shrinks in high-rate environments
- **Capital savings: 5-8pp in normal times, 2-3pp in high-rate times**

**Key insight:** The big savings come from removing VC return pressure, not escaping market interest rates entirely.

## The Traditional Lending Cost Structure

When a traditional bank makes a **10% APR loan**, the rate breaks down as follows[[1]](#ref1):

- **5%** — Cost of funds (raising capital)
- **2%** — Operating costs (processing, wages, overhead)
- **2%** — Default risk premium (covering expected losses)
- **1%** — Profit margin

This model works when all four components are low. But for fintech platform lenders serving small businesses, every component is dramatically higher.

---

## Why Platform Lenders Charge 20-50% APR

Platform lenders like Shopify, Stripe, and PayPal solved cashflow verification—they can see every transaction and accurately assess repayment capacity. But they're constrained by expensive infrastructure.

### High Cost of Capital: 8-10%

Unlike banks with deposit bases, platform lenders rely on:
- **VC equity** demanding 20-30% net IRR[[2]](#ref2)
- **Debt facilities** costing 12-15% all-in[[3]](#ref3)
- Dilution pressure from frequent fundraising rounds

**Result:** 8-10% of APR goes to servicing expensive capital, not covering defaults.

### High Operating Costs: 3-5%

Traditional payment infrastructure adds layers of cost[[4]](#ref4):
- **ACH rails:** $0.10-$0.50 per transaction
- **Settlement delays:** 1-3 business days tie up working capital
- **Reconciliation overhead:** Manual payment tracking and collections
- **Team salaries:** $200K-$500K annually for operations
- **Infrastructure:** $60K-$200K for cloud and compliance systems
- **Launch costs:** $500K-$2.5M for first 12-18 months

**Result:** 3-5% of APR goes to infrastructure overhead, not risk.

### Default Risk Premium: 10-13%

Small business lending does carry real risk. The data:
- **OnDeck** (fintech small business lender): **13.6% net charge-off rate**[[5]](#ref5)
- **Merchant cash advances:** **10-25% default rate** (mid-teens typical)[[6]](#ref6)
- **Fintech small business loans:** 3.53% delinquency rate (vs. 1.77% traditional banks)[[7]](#ref7)

**Result:** 10-13% of APR legitimately covers expected loan losses.

### Profit Margin: 2-5%

Lenders need sustainable margins:
- Financial services industry average: **~10% profit margin**[[8]](#ref8)
- Banks typically achieve: **~25% profit margins**[[9]](#ref9)
- Fintech lenders: **2-5%** after accounting for growth investment

---

## The Breakdown: 25% APR Platform Loan

For a typical **25% APR small business loan** from a platform lender:

| Component | Percentage | What It Covers |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Cost of Capital** | 8-10% | VC equity (20-30% IRR) + debt facilities (12-15%) |
| **Operating Costs** | 3-5% | ACH rails, settlement delays, staffing, infrastructure |
| **Default Risk Premium** | 10-13% | Covering actual loan losses (13.6% charge-off rate) |
| **Profit Margin** | 2-5% | Sustainable business operations |
| **Total APR** | **23-33%** | Average: ~25% APR |

**Key Insight:** About **11-15 percentage points** (44-60% of the total rate) go to **infrastructure and capital costs**—not covering actual loan losses.

---

## Why High Rates Don't Mean High Profits

If infrastructure costs are so high, are fintech lenders making huge profits? **No.** Many charge 10-50% APR and still struggle to break even.

### Standalone Fintech Lenders: Struggling Despite High Rates

**Clearco** (revenue-based financing):
- Valuation dropped **90%**: from $2B (2021) to $200M (2023)[[14]](#ref14)
- Laid off **72% of staff** between July 2022 and January 2023
- Both co-founders exited
- Complex recapitalization in October 2023, still working toward break-even
- Cited "rising interest rates not seen since the mid-90s" and "highest inflation in four decades"

**Wayflyer** (e-commerce lending):
- Lost **€76.9M in 2022**, improved to **€40.9M loss in 2023** (46% reduction)[[15]](#ref15)
- Achieved first **monthly profitability in October 2023**
- Still not fully profitable company-wide as of 2024

**Affirm** (buy-now-pay-later):
- On pace to lose **$800M in fiscal 2024**[[16]](#ref16)
- Analysts predict company will remain "deeply unprofitable through at least 2026 if not longer"
- Stock fell 8.8% amid concerns over consumer debt and regulatory scrutiny

**Upstart** (AI-powered lending):
- GAAP net loss of **$54.5M in Q2 2024**[[17]](#ref17)
- Expects profitability in Q4 2024 (not yet achieved)
- Facing higher charge-off rates and lower originations

**Uncapped** (revenue-based financing):
- **Completely abandoned the RBF model** in 2024[[18]](#ref18)
- Cited structural problems: "Loans were cheaper for lower quality businesses, while best companies were penalized for repaying quicker"
- Pivoted entirely to fixed-term loans

### Why Embedded Lenders Succeed While Standalone Lenders Struggle

**Shopify Capital** and **Stripe Capital** are profitable, but standalone lenders aren't. Why?

**1. Superior Data = Lower Default Risk**
- Shopify/Stripe see **every transaction** on their platform[[19]](#ref19)
- Direct visibility into cashflows for accurate underwriting
- Can pre-qualify merchants based on sales history
- **Result:** Lower unexpected defaults

**2. Zero Customer Acquisition Cost**
- Standalone lenders spend heavily on marketing to find borrowers
- Shopify/Stripe offer lending to **existing merchants**[[20]](#ref20)
- "Known entities" already using the platform
- **Result:** No CAC for lending business

**3. Direct Access to Payment Flows**
- Can deduct loan repayments **directly from daily sales**[[21]](#ref21)
- No ACH fees or settlement delays for collections
- Automatic reconciliation
- **Result:** 50%+ lower operational costs

**4. Revenue Diversification**
- Lending is **one of many revenue streams** (payments, subscriptions, etc.)
- Can subsidize lending to drive platform stickiness
- Not dependent on lending profitability alone
- **Result:** Sustainable even with thinner margins

### The Infrastructure Cost Crisis

Between 2022-2024, fintech lending investment dropped from $62.3B to $51.9B—**the lowest since 2020**[[22]](#ref22). Why?

- **High cost of capital:** Interest rates at highest levels since mid-90s
- **VC returns demand:** Need 20-30% IRR when borrowing costs are already 12-15%
- **Tightened underwriting:** To reduce defaults, exclude more borrowers
- **Reduced loan volumes:** Some fintech lenders stopped originating to LMI borrowers entirely

**The paradox:** Lenders charge 10-50% APR but can't achieve profitability because infrastructure costs consume the entire margin.

## How Crypto Infrastructure Reduces Costs

Crypto-native lending infrastructure can eliminate most non-risk costs:

### 1. Lower Cost of Capital: Save 8-10%

Instead of VC equity or debt facilities:
- **Stablecoin liquidity pools** with lenders earning market-rate yields (4-8%)
- No dilution pressure or fundraising cycles
- Permissionless global capital access

**Savings:** 8-10 percentage points

### 2. Lower Operating Costs: Save 2-3%

Instead of ACH rails and manual reconciliation:
- **Instant stablecoin settlement** (seconds, not days)
- No working capital tied up in settlement delays
- No ACH transaction fees ($0.10-$0.50 each)
- Programmable smart contract repayments (no manual collections)
- On-chain accounting (automatic reconciliation)

**Savings:** 2-3 percentage points

### 3. Social Trust Reduces Default Risk: Save 1-2%

Adding social accountability to cashflow verification:
- Farcaster social graph creates reputational cost of default
- Borrowers maintain persistent on-chain identity
- Community vouching supplements cashflow data
- Expected: lower default rates than pure cashflow models

**Potential savings:** 1-2 percentage points (requires validation in Phase 0)

---

## The Math: 8-15% APR Instead of 20-50%

Starting from a **25% APR platform loan** (typical for small businesses):

- **Minus 8-10%** (cheaper capital via stablecoin pools)
- **Minus 2-3%** (instant settlement, no ACH fees)
- **Minus 1-2%** (social trust reducing defaults)
- **Plus 2-5%** (maintaining sustainable profit margins)

**Result: 12-17% APR** for similar borrower risk profile

This isn't charity—it's infrastructure arbitrage. Same borrowers, same default risk, different payment rails.

---

## Why This Works Now

Five years ago, this wasn't possible. Today:

1. **Stablecoins reached $305B supply** with instant settlement[[10]](#ref10)
2. **Social protocols scaled** (Farcaster 1M+ users, Bluesky 20M+ users)[[11]](#ref11)[[12]](#ref12)
3. **Cashflow APIs matured** (Plaid, Square, Shopify verify non-W-2 income)
4. **Smart contracts proven** at scale ($50B+ DeFi TVL)[[13]](#ref13)
5. **Account abstraction** enables programmable payment streams

The infrastructure convergence happened. We're the first to assemble all the pieces for uncollateralized lending.
