### 3. Loan Use/Purpose (TWO versions)

#### Version A: Summary (1-2 sentences)
- Appears at the top of loan page
- Clear and concise
- General purpose

**Example:** "I'll use this loan to purchase a commercial sewing machine to expand my tailoring business."

#### Version B: Detailed Expansion (1-2 paragraphs)
- Appears under business description
- More specific details
- Communicate long-term effects of the loan

**What to include:**
- Why you need the money
- What you plan to do with it
- How it will help you grow
- Be as specific as possible
- Explain general and long-term effects

**Example:**
"I'll use this $2,500 loan to purchase a commercial-grade sewing machine ($2,000) and initial fabric inventory ($500). My current home sewing machine can only handle 5 alterations per week, but with a commercial machine I can triple my output to 15+ alterations weekly. This will allow me to accept catering uniform contracts from local restaurants, which require fast turnaround times. The increased capacity will grow my monthly revenue from $1,200 to $3,500 within 3 months."

### 5. Photo Requirements

## Kiva's Question Structure Philosophy

**What we can learn:**

1. **Guiding questions, not rigid fields**
   - Kiva provides questions to inspire, not enforce
   - Users write naturally in paragraph form
   - Flexibility within structure

2. **Storytelling over data**
   - Personal narrative matters more than financial metrics
   - Emotion and passion drive funding
   - "Who you are" > "What your credit score is"

3. **Two-level loan purpose**
   - Short summary for quick scanning
   - Detailed breakdown for serious lenders
   - Both are needed

4. **Photo is critical**
   - "Large influence on success"
   - Must show both person and business
   - Authenticity matters

5. **Long-term impact matters**
   - Not just "what I'll buy"
   - But "how this will change my business/life"
   - Future vision is important

## Recommended Approach for LendFriend

### Keep Kiva's Spirit:
✅ Storytelling over interrogation
✅ Guiding questions to inspire
✅ Personal voice ("I", "we")
✅ Specific details about loan use
✅ Long-term impact/vision
✅ Photo showing person + project

### Adapt for Web3 Context:
✅ Shorter responses (mobile-friendly)
✅ Leverage Farcaster profile (don't ask what we know)
✅ On-chain data replaces financial forms
✅ Social proof via mutual connections
✅ Optional photo (Farcaster pfp fallback)
✅ Add repayment confidence (Kiva relies on Trustee screening)

### Our Balanced Proposal = Kiva Simplified:

**Kiva's 3 essay sections:**
1. Personal story (2 paragraphs)
2. Business description (2 paragraphs)
3. Loan use detailed (1-2 paragraphs)

**Our 4 focused questions:**
1. Who are you and what do you do? (combines personal + business)
2. What will you use this for? (loan use with specifics)
3. What will this achieve? (impact/outcomes)
4. How will you repay? (unique to us, since Kiva screens via Trustee)

**Result:**
- Same information quality
- 50% less writing time
- Mobile-friendly
- Maintains storytelling approach
- Adds repayment confidence (which Kiva doesn't directly ask)

---

## Final Recommendation

**Use Kiva's philosophy, adapt their structure:**

1. **Keep the storytelling approach**
   - Not a bureaucratic form
   - Personal voice matters
   - Passion drives funding

2. **Provide guiding questions, not rigid fields**
   - Help users know what to write
   - Flexibility within structure
   - Examples show the way

3. **Emphasize specificity in loan use**
   - Kiva is very clear: "be as specific as possible"
   - Numbers matter
   - Breakdown builds trust

4. **Make photo optional but incentivized**
   - Kiva requires it (and sees strong results)
   - We can make it optional with fallback
   - Show the benefit: "35% faster funding"

5. **Add what Kiva doesn't have: repayment confidence**
   - Kiva relies on Trustee partners to vet borrowers
   - We're direct P2P, so lenders need this
   - Simple question: "How will you repay?"

**Our balanced proposal captures Kiva's best practices while adapting for crypto-native, mobile-first, direct P2P lending.**
