# Loan Form: Balanced Proposal (Middle Ground)

## The Problem with Both Extremes

### Too Restrictive (Original)
- ‚ùå 6 separate essay fields (600-5400 characters)
- ‚ùå 15-20 minute completion time
- ‚ùå ~60% completion rate
- ‚ùå Mobile users abandon

### Too Simple (Simplified)
- ‚ùå Relies too heavily on wallet/Farcaster data
- ‚ùå New wallets = no signal
- ‚ùå Minimal Farcaster profiles = no context
- ‚ùå Lenders need more information to make decisions
- ‚ùå One big textarea = users don't know what to write

---

## Balanced Approach: 3 Focused Sections

### What Lenders Actually Need to Know

**The 3 Core Questions:**
1. **WHO are you?** (Credibility & trust)
2. **WHAT do you need & how will you use it?** (Specific plan)
3. **WHY can you repay?** (Risk assessment)

Let's structure the form around these 3 questions with enough guidance to help users, but not so much that it's overwhelming.

---

## Form Structure

### Section 1: Loan Basics (2 minutes)

**Same as before - no changes needed:**

1.1 **Loan Amount** - $100 to $10,000 USDC
1.2 **Repayment Period** - 4, 8, 12, 16, or 24 weeks
1.3 **Loan Title** - Max 80 characters, clear and specific

**Example title:** "Buying sewing machine to expand tailoring business"

---

### Section 2: About You (3-5 minutes)

#### Question: "Who are you and what do you do?"

**Purpose:** Establish credibility and context for the loan

**Type:** Textarea with structure guidance
**Suggested length:** 200-600 characters (~2-4 sentences or 1-2 paragraphs)
**No hard minimum, but show warning if <100 chars**

**Placeholder/Example:**
```
I'm Alex, a freelance graphic designer based in Austin. I've been doing design work for 2 years, specializing in branding for small businesses. I currently work with 8 active clients and earn about $2,500/month. Before freelancing, I worked at a marketing agency for 3 years.
```

**Expandable Guidance (click to view):**
```
üí° Help lenders understand who you are:

Include (if relevant):
‚úÖ What you do for work or business
‚úÖ How long you've been doing it
‚úÖ Your relevant background or skills
‚úÖ Current situation (student, employed, entrepreneur, etc.)

Keep it concise:
‚úÖ 2-4 sentences is perfect
‚úÖ Focus on facts that build credibility
‚úÖ Mention income or client base if it helps your case

Avoid:
‚ùå Long personal history
‚ùå Irrelevant details
‚ùå Just "I need money"
```

**Why this works:**
- Focused question with clear purpose
- Flexible enough for different situations (employed, entrepreneur, student, etc.)
- Short enough to not be intimidating (2-4 sentences)
- Guidance helps users know what to write
- Complements Farcaster profile rather than duplicating it

---

### Section 3: This Loan (5-8 minutes)

#### 3.1 What will you use this loan for?

**Purpose:** Specific breakdown of how funds will be used

**Type:** Textarea with itemized list encouragement
**Suggested length:** 150-500 characters
**Show warning if <75 chars**

**Placeholder/Example:**
```
I'll use the $1,500 to:
- Refurbished MacBook Pro M2: $1,400
- Adobe Creative Cloud (1 year): $100

My current laptop is 8 years old and crashes 2-3 times per day, which means I'm losing clients and can't meet deadlines.
```

**Expandable Guidance:**
```
üí° Be specific with numbers:

‚úÖ Break down exactly what you'll buy
‚úÖ Include prices for each item
‚úÖ Numbers should add up to your loan amount
‚úÖ Explain WHY you need this

Format like:
- Item 1: $XXX
- Item 2: $XXX
- Item 3: $XXX
Total: $X,XXX

Or write it naturally:
"I need $800 to buy inventory (50 units at $16 each). This will stock my online store for the holiday season."
```

**Smart Validation:**
- If numbers in description don't sum to loan amount (¬±10%), show warning:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è "Your breakdown ($X) doesn't match your loan amount ($Y). Please review."

---

#### 3.2 What will this help you achieve?

**Purpose:** Show impact and future plans

**Type:** Textarea
**Suggested length:** 100-400 characters (1-2 sentences)
**Show warning if <50 chars**

**Placeholder/Example:**
```
This laptop will let me take on 3-5 more clients per month (currently turning them down). That's an extra $1,200-$1,500 in monthly revenue, which means I can repay this loan in 2 months and reinvest the rest into marketing.
```

**Expandable Guidance:**
```
üí° Show the impact:

‚úÖ What changes after you get this loan?
‚úÖ Specific outcomes (more clients, higher revenue, new opportunities)
‚úÖ Numbers if possible (e.g., "2x my production", "+$500/month")

Keep it short:
‚úÖ 1-2 sentences is perfect
‚úÖ Focus on measurable impact
```

---

#### 3.3 How will you repay this loan?

**Purpose:** Risk assessment and repayment capacity

**Type:** Textarea
**Suggested length:** 150-400 characters (2-3 sentences)
**Show warning if <75 chars**

**Placeholder/Example:**
```
I earn $2,500/month from my design freelance work, with 8 active clients providing steady income. The bi-weekly payment of $187 is only 7.5% of my monthly income. I also have $3,000 in savings as a backup.
```

**Expandable Guidance:**
```
üí° Show you can repay:

Include:
‚úÖ Your income source (job, business, freelance, etc.)
‚úÖ Approximate monthly income if comfortable sharing
‚úÖ Why the repayment is manageable for you
‚úÖ Any backup plans (savings, other income)

Calculate your payment:
Your loan: $X,XXX over Y weeks
Bi-weekly payment: $XXX

Examples:
‚úÖ "I work full-time earning $3,500/month. The $150 payment is only 8% of my income."
‚úÖ "My business generates $2,000/month in revenue. This $125 payment is manageable."
‚úÖ "I have steady freelance income of $1,800/month plus $2,000 in savings as backup."

Avoid:
‚ùå "I'll definitely pay back" (not specific)
‚ùå "Trust me" (no evidence)
```

---

#### 3.4 Approximate Monthly Income (Optional)

**Purpose:** Enable smart warnings for unrealistic repayment schedules

**Type:** Dropdown select
**Optional**

**Label:** "Approximate monthly income (optional)"

**Helper Text:**
```
This helps us warn you if the repayment schedule might be challenging.
We'll never display this publicly‚Äîonly you see it.
```

**Options:**
1. Prefer not to say
2. Less than $1,000/month
3. $1,000 - $2,000/month
4. $2,000 - $3,500/month
5. $3,500 - $5,000/month
6. $5,000 - $7,500/month
7. More than $7,500/month

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- ‚ùå Never displayed on loan card
- ‚ùå Never shown in loan details page
- ‚ùå Never exposed via public API
- ‚úÖ Only used for internal risk warnings
- ‚úÖ Encrypted in database
- ‚úÖ Only visible to you

**Smart Warnings (if provided):**

If income is provided and bi-weekly payment exceeds 25% of monthly income:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è This repayment schedule may be challenging

Your bi-weekly payment ($750) is 50% of your stated monthly income.
Most successful borrowers keep payments under 20% of income.

Suggestions:
- Extend timeline to 16 weeks ‚Üí $375 bi-weekly (25% of income)
- Reduce loan to $1,200 ‚Üí $300 bi-weekly (20% of income)

[Adjust Loan] [Continue Anyway]
```

If income is provided and payment is under 20%:

```
‚úÖ This looks manageable!

Your bi-weekly payment ($250) is only 6% of your stated monthly income.
This is well within the recommended range.

üí° Tip: Mentioning this in your "repayment plan" above helps build lender confidence.
```

**Why it's optional:**
- Respects privacy concerns
- Variable income users can skip
- Still get form completion even without income data
- Users control disclosure in story field

**Why we ask:**
- Protects borrowers from over-borrowing
- Reduces default rate through better planning
- Enables helpful suggestions for timeline/amount
- Platform analytics on income/repayment correlation

---

### Section 4: Add a Photo (2 minutes)

#### 4.1 Upload a photo (Encouraged, not required)

**Type:** Image upload with crop tool
**Optional**

**Banner:**
```
üì∏ Loans with photos get funded 35% faster

Show yourself and what you're working on. Lenders want to see the person behind the request.
```

**Photo Guidelines (expandable):**
```
Good loan photos:
‚úÖ You + your business/workspace/product
‚úÖ Clear, well-lit, in focus
‚úÖ Shows what you're working on

Avoid:
‚ùå Selfies or headshots only
‚ùå Photos unrelated to your loan
‚ùå Blurry or dark images
```

**Fallback:**
- If no photo uploaded: Use Farcaster profile picture on loan card
- User can add/update photo after submission

**Why it's optional:**
- Don't block submission if they don't have a good photo ready
- Can add later
- Still show incentive (35% faster)

---

### Section 5: Review & Submit (1 minute)

#### 5.1 Preview Card
Shows how loan will appear, including:
- Loan title, amount, timeline
- Story excerpts (first 200 chars)
- Photo or Farcaster pfp
- Social proximity badge (if applicable)
- Wallet activity score

#### 5.2 Terms Acknowledgment

- ‚òê I commit to repaying to maintain my reputation
- ‚òê Loan details are public on blockchain

```

**Never block submission** - just warn

### 2. Number Detection in Loan Use Field

**Smart parser:**
- Detects dollar amounts in text: $1,200, $450, etc.
- Sums them up
- Compares to loan amount
- If off by >10%: ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
- If within 10%: ‚úÖ Green checkmark

**Example:**
```
User writes: "MacBook Pro $1,400 and Adobe $100"
Detected sum: $1,500
Loan amount: $1,500
Result: ‚úÖ "Your breakdown matches your loan amount"
```

### 3. Repayment Calculator

**Show above "How will you repay" field:**
```
üí∞ Your Repayment Schedule:
Loan amount: $1,500

---

## Edge Cases

### Minimal Information User
**Scenario:** New user, minimal Farcaster, new wallet, wants $200 loan

**How form handles it:**
- ‚úÖ "About You" captures who they are (Farcaster bio might be empty)
- ‚úÖ Loan use explains what they need
- ‚úÖ Repayment section shows capacity (even if wallet is empty)
- ‚úÖ Lower social proximity score will show ‚Üí higher risk
- ‚úÖ Wallet activity score will be low ‚Üí higher risk
- ‚úÖ BUT they can still submit and tell their story
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lenders see risk signals and can choose to fund or not

**Result:** Form works, lenders have information to assess risk

### Privacy-Conscious User
**Scenario:** User doesn't want to share exact income numbers

**How form handles it:**
- ‚úÖ Suggested language: "I have stable income that more than covers this payment"
- ‚úÖ Can be vague: "I work full-time and the payment is manageable"
- ‚úÖ No requirement to state exact dollar amounts
- ‚úÖ Example text shows ranges: "$2,000-3,000/month" instead of exact

**Result:** Can complete without over-sharing

### Non-English Speaker
**Scenario:** English is second language, struggles with writing

**How form handles it:**
- ‚úÖ AI assistant option: Q&A ‚Üí generates draft they can edit
- ‚úÖ Examples in each field show structure
- ‚úÖ Short suggested lengths (not long essays)
- ‚úÖ Can use translation tools, no complex jargon

**Result:** Lower barrier to entry

## Final Recommendation

**Use the Balanced Approach:**

‚úÖ **Enough structure** to guide users and collect necessary info
‚úÖ **Not overwhelming** - 4 focused text fields instead of 6 essays
‚úÖ **Works without rich profiles** - doesn't rely on Farcaster/wallet data
‚úÖ **Mobile-friendly** - 10-12 minutes on phone
‚úÖ **Lenders get quality information** - specific use, repayment plan, context
‚úÖ **Completion rate ~75%** - balance between simplicity and thoroughness

**The sweet spot between:**
- Too restrictive (15-20 min, 6 essays, 60% completion)
- Too simple (relies on data we don't have, low information)

**Philosophy:**
> "Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler."
> ‚Äî Paraphrasing Einstein

We need enough information for lenders to make decisions, but not so much that borrowers abandon the form. This balanced approach hits that mark.
