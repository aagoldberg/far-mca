## Problem Statement

### Traditional Business Financing Challenges

**For Small Businesses:**
- 📊 **82% of small business loan applications are denied** by traditional banks
- 💰 **High interest rates** (8-25% APR) and rigid repayment schedules
- 📋 **Extensive documentation** requirements and long approval processes
- 🌍 **Geographic limitations** - businesses in developing countries have limited access
- 💳 **Collateral requirements** that many businesses cannot meet

**For Investors:**
- 🔍 **Limited deal flow** - difficulty finding and vetting small business investments
- 📈 **Lack of transparency** in business performance and fund usage
- 🏦 **Intermediary fees** reducing returns through traditional platforms
- 🌐 **Geographic restrictions** limiting global investment opportunities

### The Revenue-Based Financing Gap

Revenue-Based Financing has emerged as a business-friendly alternative to traditional loans:
- **Alignment of interests**: Investors succeed when businesses succeed
- **Flexible payments**: Payments scale with business performance
- **No equity dilution**: Businesses retain full ownership
- **Performance incentives**: Encourages sustainable growth over rapid scaling

However, existing RBF platforms are centralized, geographically limited, and lack transparent automated assessment systems.

## Credit Scoring System

### Overview
Yunus implements an automated credit assessment system combining traditional business metrics with blockchain-verified data.

### Data Sources

**1. Shopify Integration**
```typescript
interface ShopifyRevenueData {
  monthlyRevenue: number;
  revenueGrowth: number;
  orderVolume: number;
  averageOrderValue: number;
  customerRetention: number;
  accountAge: number;
}
```

**2. On-Chain History**
- Previous campaign performance
- Payment history and consistency
- Wallet age and transaction volume
- DeFi protocol interactions

**3. External Verification (Chainlink Functions)**
- Business registration verification
- Tax ID validation
- Industry risk assessment
- Regulatory compliance checks

### Scoring Algorithm

**Credit Score Calculation (0-850 scale)**
```typescript
class CreditScoringEngine {
  calculateScore(data: BusinessData): CreditScore {
    const revenueScore = this.scoreRevenue(data.revenue);      // 40%
    const stabilityScore = this.scoreStability(data.history); // 30%
    const industryScore = this.scoreIndustry(data.sector);    // 20%
    const blockchainScore = this.scoreOnChain(data.wallet);   // 10%
    
    return weightedAverage([
      [revenueScore, 0.4],
      [stabilityScore, 0.3], 
      [industryScore, 0.2],
      [blockchainScore, 0.1]
    ]);
  }
}
```

**Underwriting Decision Matrix**
- **Score 750+**: Pre-approved, best terms (3-5% revenue share, 1.2x cap)
- **Score 650-749**: Approved, standard terms (5-8% revenue share, 1.5x cap)
- **Score 550-649**: Conditional approval (8-12% revenue share, 2.0x cap)
- **Score <550**: Manual review required or declined

### Risk Assessment Framework

**Revenue Verification Levels**
1. **Green (Verified)**: Shopify integration with 6+ months history
2. **Yellow (Partial)**: Manual revenue documentation provided
3. **Red (Unverified)**: Self-reported figures only

**Industry Risk Multipliers**
- **Low Risk**: SaaS, E-commerce, Professional Services (1.0x)
- **Medium Risk**: Retail, Manufacturing, Food & Beverage (1.2x)
- **High Risk**: Crypto, Adult, Gaming, Lending (1.5x)

- **Discoverability**: Central registry of all campaigns

### RBF Campaign Lifecycle

**1. Creation Phase**
```solidity
function createCampaign(
    uint256 goalAmount,
    string memory metadataURI
) external returns (address campaignAddress) {
    // Deploy new campaign contract
    address campaign = Clones.clone(campaignImplementation);
    
    // Initialize campaign parameters
    RBFCampaign(campaign).initialize(
        msg.sender,     // creator
        goalAmount,     // funding goal
        metadataURI     // IPFS metadata
    );
    
    campaigns[nextCampaignId] = campaign;
    emit CampaignCreated(nextCampaignId++, campaign, msg.sender);
}
```

**2. Funding Phase**
```solidity
function contribute(uint256 amount) external {
    require(isActive, "Campaign not active");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be positive");
    
    // Transfer USDC from investor
    usdc.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    
    // Record contribution
    contributions[msg.sender] += amount;
    totalRaised += amount;
    
    emit ContributionMade(msg.sender, amount, totalRaised);
}
```

**3. Revenue Sharing Phase**
```solidity
function makeRevenuePayment(uint256 amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == creator, "Only creator can make payments");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be positive");
    
    // Transfer revenue payment
    usdc.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    
    // Distribute to investors proportionally
    for (address investor : investors) {
        uint256 share = (contributions[investor] * amount) / totalRaised;
        usdc.transfer(investor, share);
    }
    
    totalRepaid += amount;
    emit RevenuePaymentMade(amount, totalRepaid);
}
```

### Advanced Features

**Permit Integration (EIP-2612)**
```solidity
function contributeWithPermit(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s
) external {
    // Gasless approval via permit
    IERC20Permit(usdc).permit(
        msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
    );
    
    // Execute contribution
    contribute(amount);
}
```

**Emergency Controls**
- Creator can pause campaign in emergencies
- Investors can trigger refunds if campaign becomes inactive
- Governance mechanism for dispute resolution

}
```

### Chainlink Functions Integration

**Credit Scoring Function:**
```javascript
// Executed in Chainlink decentralized oracle network
const creditScoringFunction = `
  const { businessId, revenueData, industryCode } = args;
  
  // Fetch external business verification data
  const businessRegistry = await Functions.makeHttpRequest({
    url: 'https://api.businessregistry.gov/verify',
    params: { businessId, industryCode }
  });
  
  // Calculate credit score components
  const revenueScore = calculateRevenueScore(revenueData);
  const verificationScore = calculateVerificationScore(businessRegistry.data);
  const industryScore = getIndustryRiskScore(industryCode);
  
  // Weighted credit score calculation
  const creditScore = Math.round(
    revenueScore * 0.5 +
    verificationScore * 0.3 + 
    industryScore * 0.2
  );
  
  return Functions.encodeString(JSON.stringify({
    creditScore,
    riskLevel: creditScore > 700 ? 'low' : creditScore > 600 ? 'medium' : 'high',
    maxFundingAmount: calculateMaxFunding(revenueData, creditScore),
    recommendedTerms: calculateTerms(creditScore, industryCode)
  }));
`;
```

```typescript
class UnderwritingEngine {
  static evaluateFundingRequest(
    creditScore: number,
    monthlyRevenue: number,
    requestedAmount: number
  ): UnderwritingResult {
    
    // Revenue multiple limits based on credit score
    const maxRevenueMultiple = creditScore > 750 ? 8 : 
                              creditScore > 650 ? 6 : 
                              creditScore > 550 ? 4 : 2;
    
    const maxFundingAmount = monthlyRevenue * maxRevenueMultiple;
    
    // Risk-based pricing
    const baseRate = creditScore > 750 ? 0.03 :  // 3%
                    creditScore > 650 ? 0.05 :   // 5% 
                    creditScore > 550 ? 0.08 :   // 8%
                                       0.12;     // 12%
    
    return {
      approved: requestedAmount <= maxFundingAmount,
      maxFundingAmount,
      revenueSharePercentage: baseRate,
      repaymentCap: creditScore > 700 ? 1.5 : 2.0,
