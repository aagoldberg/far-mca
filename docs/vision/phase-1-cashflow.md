# Phase 1: Scale with Cashflow

**Status:** Planned
**Timeline:** 2025-2026
**Prerequisites:** Phase 0 complete (product stable, initial data collected, user feedback incorporated)

---

## What We're Building

Phase 1 scales beyond personal networks by adding **cashflow verification** to the social trust foundation from Phase 0.

**Key additions:**
- Larger loans: $5,000 - $50,000+
- Cashflow-based underwriting (not just social trust)
- Liquidity pools for passive lending
- Interest rates: 0-8% APR
- Potential multi-platform expansion (PMF-dependent)

**Goal:** Prove the hybrid trust + cashflow model works at scale.

## Why This Matters

Phase 0 proves social trust works, but can't serve larger needs or scale beyond personal networks. Phase 1 solves this:

**Bigger loans:** $5K-$50K+ for equipment, inventory, working capital—currently only served by predatory MCAs (20-50% APR)[[54]](../references.md#ref54)[[55]](../references.md#ref55)[[56]](../references.md#ref56) or rejected entirely.

**Passive capital:** Lenders deposit into pools and earn yield without reviewing individual loans. Capital scales beyond personal networks.

**Fair pricing:** 8-12% APR with transparent interest, no hidden fees, and on-chain credit history.

## How It Works

**1. Cashflow Verification**

Three income sources via OAuth: bank accounts (Plaid), merchant revenue (Square/Shopify), and on-chain wallet activity. Privacy-preserving—income ranges, not full transaction history.

**2. Hybrid Risk Scoring**

| Loan Size | Social Trust | Cashflow | Repayment History |
|-----------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| $100-$5K | 50% | 20% | 30% |
| $5K-$25K | 30% | 40% | 30% |
| $25K-$50K+ | 15% | 50% | 35% |

Small loans among friends weight social trust higher. Large loans weight cashflow higher. Repayment history always matters.

**3. Liquidity Pools**

Lenders deposit into shared pools, borrowers draw based on risk scores, repayments flow back. Enables passive yield, 24/7 capital access, and market-sized liquidity. Pool mechanics designed based on Phase 0 learnings.

**4. Platform Expansion**

Starts on Farcaster, may expand to other platforms (Bluesky, Reddit, Twitter/X) based on PMF. Web enhancements: fiat onramps, social login, cross-platform sharing.

## Success Metrics

Phase 1 succeeds if:
- Cashflow verification meaningfully predicts repayment behavior
- Liquidity pools attract passive capital and enable larger loans
- Borrowers choose LendFriend over traditional alternatives
- The hybrid trust + cashflow model proves viable at scale

## Next: Phase 2

→ [Phase 2: Automate Repayment](phase-2-automation.md)

Adds wallet auto-deduction and merchant revenue auto-deduction—loans that repay themselves automatically.
