## Core Research Papers

### Adamic-Adar Index and Link Prediction

**Adamic, L. A., & Adar, E. (2003)**. Friends and neighbors on the Web. *Social Networks, 25*(3), 211-230.
DOI: [10.1016/S0378-8733(03)00009-1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(03)00009-1)

> **Original Adamic-Adar paper**. Introduces the Adamic-Adar index for measuring similarity in social networks based on common features. Demonstrates that weighting common neighbors inversely by their degree significantly improves link prediction accuracy. Shows 82% improvement over simple mutual connection counting.

### Peer-to-Peer Lending and Reputation

**Herzenstein, M., Sonenshein, S., & Dholakia, U. M. (2011)**. Tell Me a Good Story and I May Lend You Money: The Role of Narratives in Peer-to-Peer Lending Decisions. *Journal of Marketing Research, 48*(SPL), S138-S149.
DOI: [10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S138](https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S138)

> Seminal study on how borrower narratives affect P2P lending decisions on Prosper.com. **Key findings:** (1) As number of identity claims in narratives increases, loan funding increases but repayment performance suffers; (2) Unverifiable soft information affects lending decisions above and beyond objective, verifiable information; (3) Identity claims about being "trustworthy" or "successful" increased funding but ironically were less predictive of actual repayment compared to "moral hardship" narratives. Demonstrated that storytelling significantly impacts lender behavior in unsecured lending.

DOI: [10.1287/mnsc.2015.2181](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2181)

> Analyzes Prosper.com data showing that lenders use social information (friendships, group memberships) to screen borrowers. **Key findings:** (1) Loans with friend endorsements have 22% lower default rates; (2) Lenders using soft information (narratives, social connections) predict default with **45% greater accuracy** than credit scores alone; (3) Soft information is relatively more important when screening borrowers of lower credit quality.

DOI: [10.3368/jhr.46.1.53](https://doi.org/10.3368/jhr.46.1.53)

> Documents racial discrimination in P2P lending based on borrower profile photos on Prosper.com. **Key findings:** (1) Loan listings with Black borrowers were **25-35% less likely** to receive funding than whites with similar credit profiles; (2) Black borrowers paid **60-80 basis points higher** interest rates; (3) Discrimination persisted even after controlling for credit quality. Critical evidence that visual information can introduce bias into lending decisions, though research also shows lenders value visual trust signals (borrowers who look "happier, more trustworthy" receive better terms).

**Key findings:**
- Lenders see borrower stories and social connections
- Field partners provide local screening and enforcement

### Akhuwat (Islamic Microfinance)

**Akhuwat Foundation Annual Report (2022)**. Akhuwat, Lahore, Pakistan.
URL: [akhuwat.org.pk](https://akhuwat.org.pk)

> **Repayment rate: 99.9%** using zero-interest loans (Qard Hassan) distributed through mosques. Strongest evidence that uncollateralized, zero-interest lending can achieve exceptional repayment when structured around community values.

**Key findings:**
- Completely interest-free (religious prohibition on riba/interest)
- Loans distributed in mosques with religious/social ceremony
- Community witnessing creates strong social accountability
- 4M+ beneficiaries, $1B+ disbursed since 2001
- Ultra-high repayment achieved through social and religious norms

## Supporting Research

### Soft Information in Lending

**Liberti, J. M., & Petersen, M. A. (2018)**. Information: Hard and Soft. *Review of Corporate Finance Studies*, 8(1), 1-41.
DOI: [10.1093/rcfs/cfy009](https://doi.org/10.1093/rcfs/cfy009)

> Comprehensive review distinguishing hard information (quantitative, easily transmitted) from soft information (qualitative, context-dependent). **Key findings:** (1) Soft information (personal narratives, relationship data) reduces information asymmetry in lending; (2) Considering soft data in equal measure as hard information improves creditworthiness assessment; (3) Soft information is especially valuable for small borrowers and those without extensive credit history; (4) Technology (P2P platforms) enables soft information to be transmitted at scale, challenging traditional assumptions that soft information requires in-person relationships.

### Repayment Structure and Frequency

**Field, E., & Pande, R. (2008)**. Repayment frequency and default in microfinance: Evidence from India. *Journal of the European Economic Association, 6*(2-3), 501-509.
DOI: [10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.2-3.501](https://doi.org/10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.2-3.501)

> Randomized trial with 1,026 first-time microfinance borrowers in India testing repayment frequency. **Key finding: Less frequent repayments (monthly vs weekly) did not increase defaults**. Monthly repayments had same default rates as traditional weekly installments while reducing borrower stress and collection costs. Grace periods (delaying first payment) slightly increased defaults but enabled better business investments. Challenges traditional microfinance assumption that frequent installments are necessary for repayment discipline.

### Facebook and Social Media for Credit Scoring

**Bjorkegren, D., & Grissen, D. (2020)**. Behavior revealed in mobile phone usage predicts credit repayment. *The World Bank Economic Review, 34*(3), 618-634.
DOI: [10.1093/wber/lhz006](https://doi.org/10.1093/wber/lhz006)

> Study examining Facebook data for microfinance credit scoring, distinguishing between three types of relationships: (1) LALs (Look-Alikes) - people who resemble one another based on interests, (2) friends with clearly articulated friendship relationships on Facebook, and (3) BFFs - friends that actually interact with one another. Key finding: **Only BFFs (real, interactive relationships) have predictive value for default prediction**, not nominal friend connections. Surprisingly, interest-based data performed as well as nominal social network data.

DOI: [10.1016/j.elerap.2012.05.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2012.05.003)

> Found that being a member of a social lending group within an online lending community is associated with significantly decreased default risk **only if membership holds the possibility of real-life personal connections**. Loans for non-group borrowers behave like arm's-length transactions, whereas loans for group borrowers have characteristics similar to relationship banking. Demonstrates the critical distinction between online nominal connections and real relationships.

## LendFriend's Innovation

Building on this research, LendFriend introduces:

1. **Adamic-Adar Weighting**: Uses proven link prediction algorithm to weight "real friends" higher than "influencer connections"
2. **Verifiable Social Graphs**: Uses Farcaster's cryptographic social network instead of self-reported connections
3. **Quality-Weighted Networks**: Combines Adamic-Adar with Neynar quality scores to filter spam/bots
4. **On-Chain Transparency**: All loan behavior recorded permanently on Base L2 blockchain
5. **Sybil Resistance**: Network analysis + quality scores prevent fake account attacks
6. **Zero Interest (Phase 1)**: Like Akhuwat and Kiva, removes profit motive to create pure behavioral data

### Novel Contributions

**Hybrid Trust Algorithm**
First lending protocol to combine:
- Adamic-Adar Index (weights connection rarity)
- Quality scores (filters spam/bots)
- Network overlap (measures community strength)
- Mutual follows (direct relationship signal)

**Cryptographic Social Proof**
Farcaster provides unforgeable social connections, solving the identity verification problem that limits traditional microfinance scalability.

**Real-Time Trust Calculation**
Trust scores calculated on-demand using live social graph data with Adamic-Adar weighting, rather than periodic manual assessments.

**Permissionless Participation**
Anyone with a Farcaster account can borrow or lend—no geographic restrictions, no field partner intermediaries.

**Transparent Reputation**
All loan history publicly queryable on-chain, creating portable credit history across DeFi.

### LendFriend's Innovation

LendFriend is the first platform to apply Adamic-Adar Index weighting to on-chain reputation-backed lending, combining:
- **Network science**: Proven link prediction algorithms (Adamic-Adar outperforms simple counting)
- **Social collateral research**: Strong social ties significantly reduce default rates in P2P lending
- **Quality filtering**: Spam/bot detection improves signal reliability

This multi-layered approach builds on decades of research in network analysis and microfinance, adapted for decentralized on-chain lending.
