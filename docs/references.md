## Core Research Papers

### Adamic-Adar Index and Link Prediction

#### [2] Adamic & Adar (2003) {#adamic-and-adar-2003}

**Adamic, L. A., & Adar, E. (2003)**. Friends and neighbors on the Web. *Social Networks, 25*(3), 211-230.
DOI: [10.1016/S0378-8733(03)00009-1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(03)00009-1)

> **Original Adamic-Adar paper**. Introduces the Adamic-Adar index for measuring similarity in social networks based on common features. Demonstrates that weighting common neighbors inversely by their degree significantly improves link prediction accuracy. Shows 82% improvement over simple mutual connection counting.

---

#### [3] Liben-Nowell & Kleinberg (2007) {#liben-nowell-and-kleinberg-2007}

**Liben-Nowell, D., & Kleinberg, J. (2007)**. The link-prediction problem for social networks. *Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 58*(7), 1019-1031.
DOI: [10.1002/asi.20591](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20591)

> Comprehensive benchmark study comparing 20+ link prediction algorithms. Adamic-Adar consistently ranks in top-3 performers across multiple social networks. Demonstrates that local similarity measures often outperform global metrics for predicting new connections.

---

### Network Algorithms Comparison: Adamic-Adar vs PageRank/Centrality

#### Research Question

Could PageRank or eigenvector centrality (measuring network influence and peer pressure from influential connections) improve prediction over Adamic-Adar's focus on close selective friends?

#### Strong Ties vs Influential Connections (2022)

#### [4] Mobile Micro-Lending (2022) {#mobile-micro-lending-2022}

**Social capital, phone call activities and borrower default in mobile micro-lending (2022)**. *Applied Economics*

> Study on mobile micro-lending found that calling activities associated with **stronger social ties have greater predictive power for loan defaults** than those associated with weaker ties. Strong ties (people on the borrower's contact list) were more powerful predictors than weak ties.

**Counterintuitive Result on Kinship**: Family/kin connections showed **negative or neutral associations** with repayment in 88% of microfinance studies due to: (1) family members reluctant to sanction each other, (2) competing kin outside the group get priority, (3) economic competition among relatives.

---

#### What Actually Drives Repayment: Repeated Interaction > Closeness

#### [5] Banking on Cooperation (2023) {#banking-on-cooperation-2023}

**Banking on cooperation: an evolutionary analysis of microfinance loan repayment behaviour (2023)**. *Evolutionary Human Sciences*

> Evolutionary analysis found that **mechanisms enabling monitoring and enforcement through repeated interaction matter more** than emotional closeness or kinship.

**Repayment Predictors (ranked)**:
- **Partner choice** (44% positive associations)
- **Prior interaction frequency** (50-60% positive)
- **Geographic proximity** (47% positive, mixed)
- **Kinship** (12% positive, 88% negative/neutral)

**Implication**: Ability to monitor and enforce matters more than relationship strength alone.

---

#### Network Centrality Predicts Default Risk (2022-2025)

#### [6] Chen et al. (2022) {#chen-et-al-2022}

**Chen et al. (2022)**. Network centrality effects in peer to peer lending. *Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications*

> First study testing degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality in P2P lending credit default modeling. **Key findings:** (1) Borrower's network position positively contributes to classification of default risk; (2) Degree centrality enhances predictive power in default models; (3) Network topological features add value beyond traditional credit features.

#### [7] Network Centrality & Credit Risk (2025) {#network-centrality-credit-risk-2025}

**Network centrality and credit risk: A comprehensive analysis (2025)**. *Journal of Marketing Analytics*

> Recent analysis using Renrendai (Chinese P2P platform) data: (1) Degree centrality (number of connections) improves default prediction; (2) Eigenvector centrality (connections to influential people) positively moderated funding success; (3) Borrowers with higher connectivity had better repayment rates.

---

#### Algorithm Performance: Adamic-Adar vs PageRank

**Link Prediction Benchmarks** (closest analog to credit relationships):

**Adamic-Adar**:
- AUC score: 0.92 (very strong)
- Local measure (O(N) complexity)
- Ranking: Katz > Preferential Attachment > Adamic-Adar > Common Neighbors
- Best for identifying selective mutual friends with small networks

**PageRank/EigenVector Centrality**:
- Global measure (computationally expensive)
- Measures network-wide influence
- Requires complete network topology
- PageRank = variant of Eigenvector Centrality with random jump

**Trade-off**: Local measures (Adamic-Adar) are fast and capture close relationships. Global measures (PageRank) capture influence but require full network data and more computation.

**Sources**: Link prediction comparative studies; PageRank centrality algorithms for weighted directed networks (2021)

---

#### The Double-Edged Sword of Social Pressure

#### [8] Social Ties in Crisis (2024) {#social-ties-crisis-2024}

**Microfinance borrowers' social ties can bring stability or chaos (2024)**. Crisis analysis

> **Critical finding**: Social pressures that ensure repayment in good times can **accelerate defaults during crises**. Joint liability can spread defaults across groups during liquidity crunches—the same social mechanisms that create accountability can transmit failure.

**Peer Pressure Dynamics**:
- Works well when borrowers want to maintain relationships
- But: "Successful members highly intolerant of less successful members, even when not their fault"
- Peer pressure can undermine trust and exclude vulnerable members
- May backfire during systemic shocks

**Source**: Group-lending model and social closure research (2010)

---

#### Evidence-Based Algorithm Choice

**Why LendFriend Uses Adamic-Adar (Primarily)**:

1. **Strong ties more predictive than influential connections** - close selective friends enable monitoring, repeated interaction creates accountability
2. **Computational efficiency** - local measure, works with incomplete social graph data
3. **Proven performance** - 0.92 AUC, top-3 algorithm, 82% better than simple counting

**Potential Role for PageRank/Centrality (Phase 2)**:

Research suggests network centrality adds predictive value as **supplementary signal**:

```
Possible Hybrid: 70% Adamic-Adar + 30% Centrality

Where Centrality = Borrower PageRank, Lender PageRank, or Mutual Connection Centrality
```

**Weighting rationale**:
- Primary (70%): Close friends via repeated interaction monitoring
- Secondary (30%): Network influence effects

**Implementation consideration**: PageRank requires global network computation, increasing API costs. Needs cost-benefit analysis.

### Group Lending and Social Collateral

#### [9] Besley & Coate (1995) {#besley-and-coate-1995}

**Besley, T., & Coate, S. (1995)**. Group lending, repayment incentives and social collateral. *Journal of Development Economics, 46*(1), 1-18.
DOI: [10.1016/0304-3878(94)00045-E](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3878(94)00045-E)

> **Foundational paper** establishing that social collateral can substitute for traditional collateral in lending. Demonstrates how group lending creates peer monitoring and social sanctions that improve repayment rates.

#### [10] Feigenberg et al. (2013) {#feigenberg-et-al-2013}

**Feigenberg, B., Field, E., & Pande, R. (2013)**. The economic returns to social interaction: Experimental evidence from microfinance. *The Review of Economic Studies, 80*(4), 1459-1483.
DOI: [10.1093/restud/rdt016](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdt016)

> Shows that increased meeting frequency in microfinance groups builds social capital and improves repayment rates by creating persistent social ties and information sharing networks.

### Peer-to-Peer Lending and Reputation

#### [11] Herzenstein et al. (2011) {#herzenstein-et-al-2011}

**Herzenstein, M., Sonenshein, S., & Dholakia, U. M. (2011)**. Tell Me a Good Story and I May Lend You Money: The Role of Narratives in Peer-to-Peer Lending Decisions. *Journal of Marketing Research, 48*(SPL), S138-S149.
DOI: [10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S138](https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S138)

> Seminal study on how borrower narratives affect P2P lending decisions on Prosper.com. **Key findings:** (1) As number of identity claims in narratives increases, loan funding increases but repayment performance suffers; (2) Unverifiable soft information affects lending decisions above and beyond objective, verifiable information; (3) Identity claims about being "trustworthy" or "successful" increased funding but ironically were less predictive of actual repayment compared to "moral hardship" narratives. Demonstrated that storytelling significantly impacts lender behavior in unsecured lending.

#### [12] Iyer et al. (2016) {#iyer-et-al-2016}

**Iyer, R., Khwaja, A. I., Luttmer, E. F., & Shue, K. (2016)**. Screening peers softly: Inferring the quality of small borrowers. *Management Science, 62*(6), 1554-1577.
DOI: [10.1287/mnsc.2015.2181](https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2181)

> Analyzes Prosper.com data showing that lenders use social information (friendships, group memberships) to screen borrowers. **Key findings:** (1) Loans with friend endorsements have 22% lower default rates overall, but critically, **friend bids (actual capital contributions) reduce defaults by 14%**—validating capital-backed social trust; (2) Lenders using soft information (narratives, social connections) predict default with **45% greater accuracy** than credit scores alone; (3) Soft information is relatively more important when screening borrowers of lower credit quality. **Critical distinction:** This complements Freedman & Jin (2017) showing only capital-backed endorsements work—Iyer et al. quantifies the magnitude of friend capital contributions.

**Duarte, J., Siegel, S., & Young, L. (2012)**. Trust and Credit: The Role of Appearance in Peer-to-peer Lending. *Review of Financial Studies*, 25(8), 2455-2484.
DOI: [10.1093/rfs/hhs071](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhs071)

> Examines how appearance-based impressions affect financial transactions using photographs from Prosper.com. **Key findings:** (1) Borrowers appearing more trustworthy have higher funding probabilities and receive **~50 basis points lower interest rates**; (2) Appearance correlates with actual credit quality—trustworthy-looking borrowers had better credit scores and lower default rates; (3) Visual trust signals matter in financial transactions because they predict both investor and borrower behavior. Shows that appearance provides legitimate information about creditworthiness, not just bias.

NBER Working Paper: [w19820](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19820)

> **Critical finding on empty vs. capital-backed endorsements:** Borrowers with social ties received more funding and lower interest rates, but **most borrowers with social ties were more likely to default**. The exception: **only endorsements from friends who also contributed money produced consistently better repayment**. Empty endorsements were "cheap talk" that misled lenders; capital-backed vouching aligned incentives. Suggests caution for using online social networks as quality signals unless friends have "skin in the game."

> Analyzes herding behavior in Prosper.com loan auctions, finding that **strategic herding improves lending outcomes**. Key findings: (1) A 1% increase in bids increases likelihood of additional bids by 15% (pre-funding); (2) After full funding, herding effect drops to 5%; (3) **Loans with more herding have better subsequent repayment performance**; (4) Unlike counterproductive herding in eBay auctions, herding in P2P lending is strategic and beneficial. Demonstrates that early lender participation serves as a quality signal that attracts informed follow-on lenders, creating positive information cascades.

DOI: [10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.01.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.01.005)

> Foundational research on the **identifiable victim effect**: people donate significantly more to an identified individual with a story than to statistical information about a group. Shows that emotional engagement with specific people (not abstract numbers) drives prosocial behavior. Classic study demonstrated donors gave more when shown "Rokia, a 7-year-old girl from Mali" than when presented with statistics about millions of African children at risk. Critical insight: combining emotional stories with statistics actually reduces donations compared to stories alone—people connect to individuals, not data.

> Documents Prosper's early fraud issues including "pump and dump" bidding manipulation and group leader reward misalignment. Group leaders received ~$12 per funded loan, creating incentives to fund poor-quality loans. Research found that "the estimated returns of group loans are significantly lower than those of non-group loans" and that "group leader rewards motivated leaders to fund lower quality loans in order to earn the rewards." Approximately 18.5% of all money loaned through Prosper from February 2006 through June 2008 were in some form of delinquency. More than 35% of all loans that originated in February 2007 were in some form of delinquency.

> Comprehensive analysis of China's P2P lending collapse. By mid-2019, among 6,618 Chinese P2P platforms, 5,774 ended in bankruptcy or business failure (87.2% failure rate). Fraud was a main contributor. **Ezubao case:** 95% of projects were fake using "straw borrowers"—shell companies controlled by the Yucheng Group. The group purchased borrower information for $121.6 million to fabricate projects. On Renrendai platform, the probability of default by new borrowers was 56%. Synthetic identity fraud, loan stacking, and fake borrower schemes were prevalent. Demonstrates the catastrophic consequences of inadequate fraud prevention.

URL: [news.utdallas.edu/business-management/social-media-crowdfunding-2022](https://news.utdallas.edu/business-management/social-media-crowdfunding-2022/)

> University of Texas at Dallas study analyzing crowdfunding campaign dynamics found that social media is **most effective in the first 10 days** of a campaign, with the average number of donors, amount donated, and amount per donor highest during this period. Campaigns that don't perform well at the outset are unlikely to succeed. **Critical finding:** If a campaign does not reach at least **70% of its goal after 20 days** since launch, it is not likely to be successful.

**Key findings:**
- First 10 days determine campaign trajectory
- 70% funding = psychological tipping point
- Early participation triggers more participation
- Late-stage contributions accelerate above 70%

#### [45] GoFundMe Storytelling (2024) {#optimal-story-length}

**GoFundMe (2024)**. Craft Your Story: Crowdfunding Storytelling Best Practices. Platform guidance on fundraiser narrative optimization.
URL: [gofundme.com/en-ca/c/crowdfunding-lessons/story](https://www.gofundme.com/en-ca/c/crowdfunding-lessons/story)

> GoFundMe's platform data shows fundraiser descriptions with **400 words or more receive more donations**. Research also shows fundraiser titles with **4-8 words make the most money**. The guidance emphasizes that while length matters, authentic storytelling quality ultimately drives donation success.

**Key recommendations:**
- Minimum 400 words for fundraiser descriptions
- Answer donor questions upfront (who you are, why it matters)
- Explain transparently how donations will be used
- Break text into sections with subheadings for readability

**Academic support:** Lagazio and Querci (2018) found that reward-based crowdfunding campaigns should use "at least 500 words" in textual descriptions, as detailed text is more persuasive than videos. However, Barbi and Bigelli (2017) cautioned that excessively wordy descriptions could denote a lack of conciseness that harms reader attention.
