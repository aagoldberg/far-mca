## Core Research Papers

### Adamic-Adar Index and Link Prediction

<span id="adamic-and-adar-2003"></span>
**[2] Adamic, L. A., & Adar, E. (2003)**. Friends and neighbors on the Web. *Social Networks, 25*(3), 211-230.
DOI: [10.1016/S0378-8733(03)00009-1](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-8733(03)00009-1)

> **Original Adamic-Adar paper**. Introduces the Adamic-Adar index for measuring similarity in social networks based on common features. Demonstrates that weighting common neighbors inversely by their degree significantly improves link prediction accuracy. Shows 82% improvement over simple mutual connection counting.

---

<span id="liben-nowell-and-kleinberg-2007"></span>
**[3] Liben-Nowell, D., & Kleinberg, J. (2007)**. The link-prediction problem for social networks. *Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 58*(7), 1019-1031.
DOI: [10.1002/asi.20591](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.20591)

> Comprehensive benchmark study comparing 20+ link prediction algorithms. Adamic-Adar consistently ranks in top-3 performers across multiple social networks. Demonstrates that local similarity measures often outperform global metrics for predicting new connections.

---

### Network Algorithms Comparison: Adamic-Adar vs PageRank/Centrality

#### Research Question

Could PageRank or eigenvector centrality (measuring network influence and peer pressure from influential connections) improve prediction over Adamic-Adar's focus on close selective friends?

#### Strong Ties vs Influential Connections (2022)

<span id="mobile-micro-lending-2022"></span>
**[4] Social capital, phone call activities and borrower default in mobile micro-lending (2022)**. *Applied Economics*

> Study on mobile micro-lending found that calling activities associated with **stronger social ties have greater predictive power for loan defaults** than those associated with weaker ties. Strong ties (people on the borrower's contact list) were more powerful predictors than weak ties.

**Counterintuitive Result on Kinship**: Family/kin connections showed **negative or neutral associations** with repayment in 88% of microfinance studies due to: (1) family members reluctant to sanction each other, (2) competing kin outside the group get priority, (3) economic competition among relatives.

---

#### What Actually Drives Repayment: Repeated Interaction > Closeness

<span id="banking-on-cooperation-2023"></span>
**[5] Banking on cooperation: an evolutionary analysis of microfinance loan repayment behaviour (2023)**. *Evolutionary Human Sciences*

> Evolutionary analysis found that **mechanisms enabling monitoring and enforcement through repeated interaction matter more** than emotional closeness or kinship.

**Repayment Predictors (ranked)**:
- **Partner choice** (44% positive associations)
- **Prior interaction frequency** (50-60% positive)
- **Geographic proximity** (47% positive, mixed)
- **Kinship** (12% positive, 88% negative/neutral)

**Implication**: Ability to monitor and enforce matters more than relationship strength alone.

---

#### Network Centrality Predicts Default Risk (2022-2025)

<span id="chen-et-al-2022"></span>
**[6] Chen et al. (2022)**. Network centrality effects in peer to peer lending. *Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications*

> First study testing degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality in P2P lending credit default modeling. **Key findings:** (1) Borrower's network position positively contributes to classification of default risk; (2) Degree centrality enhances predictive power in default models; (3) Network topological features add value beyond traditional credit features.

<span id="network-centrality-credit-risk-2025"></span>
**[7] Network centrality and credit risk: A comprehensive analysis (2025)**. *Journal of Marketing Analytics*

> Recent analysis using Renrendai (Chinese P2P platform) data: (1) Degree centrality (number of connections) improves default prediction; (2) Eigenvector centrality (connections to influential people) positively moderated funding success; (3) Borrowers with higher connectivity had better repayment rates.

---

#### Algorithm Performance: Adamic-Adar vs PageRank

**Link Prediction Benchmarks** (closest analog to credit relationships):

**Adamic-Adar**:
- AUC score: 0.92 (very strong)
- Local measure (O(N) complexity)
- Ranking: Katz > Preferential Attachment > Adamic-Adar > Common Neighbors
- Best for identifying selective mutual friends with small networks

**PageRank/EigenVector Centrality**:
- Global measure (computationally expensive)
- Measures network-wide influence
- Requires complete network topology
- PageRank = variant of Eigenvector Centrality with random jump

**Trade-off**: Local measures (Adamic-Adar) are fast and capture close relationships. Global measures (PageRank) capture influence but require full network data and more computation.

**Sources**: Link prediction comparative studies; PageRank centrality algorithms for weighted directed networks (2021)

#### The Double-Edged Sword of Social Pressure

<span id="social-ties-crisis-2024"></span>
**[8] Microfinance borrowers' social ties can bring stability or chaos (2024)**. Crisis analysis

> **Critical finding**: Social pressures that ensure repayment in good times can **accelerate defaults during crises**. Joint liability can spread defaults across groups during liquidity crunches—the same social mechanisms that create accountability can transmit failure.

**Peer Pressure Dynamics**:
- Works well when borrowers want to maintain relationships
- But: "Successful members highly intolerant of less successful members, even when not their fault"
- Peer pressure can undermine trust and exclude vulnerable members
- May backfire during systemic shocks

**Source**: Group-lending model and social closure research (2010)

---

#### Evidence-Based Algorithm Choice

**Why LendFriend Uses Adamic-Adar (Primarily)**:

1. **Strong ties more predictive than influential connections** - close selective friends enable monitoring, repeated interaction creates accountability
2. **Computational efficiency** - local measure, works with incomplete social graph data
3. **Proven performance** - 0.92 AUC, top-3 algorithm, 82% better than simple counting

**Potential Role for PageRank/Centrality (Phase 2)**:

Research suggests network centrality adds predictive value as **supplementary signal**:

```
Possible Hybrid: 70% Adamic-Adar + 30% Centrality

Where Centrality = Borrower PageRank, Lender PageRank, or Mutual Connection Centrality
```

**Weighting rationale**:
- Primary (70%): Close friends via repeated interaction monitoring
- Secondary (30%): Network influence effects

**Implementation consideration**: PageRank requires global network computation, increasing API costs. Needs cost-benefit analysis.

DOI: [10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S138](https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S138)

> Seminal study on how borrower narratives affect P2P lending decisions on Prosper.com. **Key findings:** (1) As number of identity claims in narratives increases, loan funding increases but repayment performance suffers; (2) Unverifiable soft information affects lending decisions above and beyond objective, verifiable information; (3) Identity claims about being "trustworthy" or "successful" increased funding but ironically were less predictive of actual repayment compared to "moral hardship" narratives. Demonstrated that storytelling significantly impacts lender behavior in unsecured lending.

DOI: [10.1093/rfs/hhs071](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhs071)

> Examines how appearance-based impressions affect financial transactions using photographs from Prosper.com. **Key findings:** (1) Borrowers appearing more trustworthy have higher funding probabilities and receive **~50 basis points lower interest rates**; (2) Appearance correlates with actual credit quality—trustworthy-looking borrowers had better credit scores and lower default rates; (3) Visual trust signals matter in financial transactions because they predict both investor and borrower behavior. Shows that appearance provides legitimate information about creditworthiness, not just bias.

DOI: [10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.01.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.01.005)

> Foundational research on the **identifiable victim effect**: people donate significantly more to an identified individual with a story than to statistical information about a group. Shows that emotional engagement with specific people (not abstract numbers) drives prosocial behavior. Classic study demonstrated donors gave more when shown "Rokia, a 7-year-old girl from Mali" than when presented with statistics about millions of African children at risk. Critical insight: combining emotional stories with statistics actually reduces donations compared to stories alone—people connect to individuals, not data.

> Neural research examining how Kiva borrower photographs and stories affect lending decisions. Found that **positive arousal from viewing borrower photos directly predicts lending success** at market scale. Brain imaging showed nucleus accumbens (reward center) activation when viewing borrower profiles predicted both individual willingness to lend and aggregate lending rates across thousands of loans. Demonstrates that emotional engagement isn't just psychological—it's measurable in neural response and correlates with actual financial decisions.

> **Repayment rate: 99.9%** using zero-interest loans (Qard Hassan) distributed through mosques. Strongest evidence that uncollateralized, zero-interest lending can achieve exceptional repayment when structured around community values.

**Key findings:**
- Completely interest-free (religious prohibition on riba/interest)
- Loans distributed in mosques with religious/social ceremony
- Community witnessing creates strong social accountability
- 4M+ beneficiaries, $1B+ disbursed since 2001
- Ultra-high repayment achieved through social and religious norms

**[28] Liberti, J. M., & Petersen, M. A. (2018)**. Information: Hard and Soft. *Review of Corporate Finance Studies*, 8(1), 1-41.
DOI: [10.1093/rcfs/cfy009](https://doi.org/10.1093/rcfs/cfy009)

> Comprehensive review distinguishing hard information (quantitative, easily transmitted) from soft information (qualitative, context-dependent). **Key findings:** (1) Soft information (personal narratives, relationship data) reduces information asymmetry in lending; (2) Considering soft data in equal measure as hard information improves creditworthiness assessment; (3) Soft information is especially valuable for small borrowers and those without extensive credit history; (4) Technology (P2P platforms) enables soft information to be transmitted at scale, challenging traditional assumptions that soft information requires in-person relationships.

DOI: [10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.2-3.501](https://doi.org/10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.2-3.501)

> Randomized trial with 1,026 first-time microfinance borrowers in India testing repayment frequency. **Key finding: Less frequent repayments (monthly vs weekly) did not increase defaults**. Monthly repayments had same default rates as traditional weekly installments while reducing borrower stress and collection costs. Grace periods (delaying first payment) slightly increased defaults but enabled better business investments. Challenges traditional microfinance assumption that frequent installments are necessary for repayment discipline.

DOI: [10.1093/wber/lhz006](https://doi.org/10.1093/wber/lhz006)

> Study examining Facebook data for microfinance credit scoring, distinguishing between three types of relationships: (1) LALs (Look-Alikes) - people who resemble one another based on interests, (2) friends with clearly articulated friendship relationships on Facebook, and (3) BFFs - friends that actually interact with one another. Key finding: **Only BFFs (real, interactive relationships) have predictive value for default prediction**, not nominal friend connections. Surprisingly, interest-based data performed as well as nominal social network data.

DOI: [10.1016/j.elerap.2012.05.003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elerap.2012.05.003)

> Found that being a member of a social lending group within an online lending community is associated with significantly decreased default risk **only if membership holds the possibility of real-life personal connections**. Loans for non-group borrowers behave like arm's-length transactions, whereas loans for group borrowers have characteristics similar to relationship banking. Demonstrates the critical distinction between online nominal connections and real relationships.

URL: [news.utdallas.edu/business-management/social-media-crowdfunding-2022](https://news.utdallas.edu/business-management/social-media-crowdfunding-2022/)

> University of Texas at Dallas study analyzing crowdfunding campaign dynamics found that social media is **most effective in the first 10 days** of a campaign, with the average number of donors, amount donated, and amount per donor highest during this period. Campaigns that don't perform well at the outset are unlikely to succeed. **Critical finding:** If a campaign does not reach at least **70% of its goal after 20 days** since launch, it is not likely to be successful.

**Key findings:**
- First 10 days determine campaign trajectory
- 70% funding = psychological tipping point
- Early participation triggers more participation
- Late-stage contributions accelerate above 70%
