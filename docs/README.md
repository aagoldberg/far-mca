# Introduction

## Welcome to LendFriend Documentation

LendFriend enables uncollateralized lending by quantifying social trust. Your network doesn't just vouch for you—they algorithmically prove your creditworthiness through measurable social proximity.

This documentation explains exactly how we turn relationships into credit scores.

## Built on Proven Research

LendFriend's mechanics are grounded in decades of microfinance research:

- **Grameen Bank**: 97-98% repayment rate across 9.6M borrowers using social collateral
- **Kiva**: 96.3% repayment rate on $1.8B+ in peer-to-peer loans
- **Akhuwat**: 99.9% repayment rate with zero-interest Islamic microfinance
- **Academic Foundation**: 30+ peer-reviewed papers on social collateral, network effects, and reputation systems
