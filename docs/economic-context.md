# Economic Context: Why Now?

Five economic and technological trends converged in 2024-2025 to make uncollateralized crypto lending possible for the first time.

---

## 1. Work Went Global

Platforms like Upwork, Shopify, and YouTube created a $1+ trillion global economy where 1.6 billion people now earn income borderlessly[[1]](#ref1). AI tools enabled solo entrepreneurs to run $50K-$500K businesses—68% of small businesses now use AI[[2]](#ref2). This new workforce operates outside traditional employment: no W-2s, no fixed salaries, income from platform fees, merchant sales, creator subscriptions, and DAO payments. Their income is real and verifiable, but invisible to traditional finance.

## 2. Capital Didn't Follow

While work globalized, finance stayed expensive. 77% of small businesses struggle to access capital[[3]](#ref3), and banks reject 1 in 4 borrowers[[4]](#ref4). Platform lenders like Shopify, Stripe, and PayPal can verify cashflow, but charge 10-50% APR due to infrastructure costs: ACH rails ($0.10-$0.50/transaction, 1-3 day settlement)[[5]](#ref5), VC equity requiring 20%+ returns, debt facilities at 8-15%, and operational overhead ($500K-$2.5M to launch, $200K-$500K annual salaries, compliance costs)[[5]](#ref5). The gap isn't access to capital—it's access to affordable capital.

Specific platform rates: Shopify Capital charges factor rates of 1.1-1.13 (20-50% APR equivalent)[[6]](#ref6), Stripe Capital charges factor rates of 1.06-1.20 (10-45% APR)[[7]](#ref7), and PayPal Business Loans range from 10-18% APR[[8]](#ref8).

## 3. Stablecoins Reached Scale

By 2025, stablecoins reached $305B supply with $27.6T in transfer volume[[9]](#ref9)—surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. Major institutions are integrating: Visa's stablecoin prefunding pilot[[10]](#ref10), Zelle's cross-border initiatives[[11]](#ref11), Remitly's wallets[[12]](#ref12), Stripe's payment processing. Stablecoins settle in seconds with no ACH fees, 80% lower cross-border costs[[13]](#ref13), and zero working capital locked in transit. Most importantly, they created a global pool of liquid capital earning 4-8% yields—permissionless, programmable, available 24/7.

## 4. DeFi Proved the Tech

DeFi collateralized lending (Aave, Compound) reached $50B TVL with <5% default rates[[14]](#ref14), proving smart contracts can manage loans at scale. Early uncollateralized protocols (Goldfinch, Maple) showed credit models work on-chain with institutional borrowers: Goldfinch financed $110M across 20+ countries[[15]](#ref15), Maple grew to $562M TVL (1,600% increase from 2023)[[16]](#ref16). They proved the fundamental pieces work—smart contracts enforce repayment, on-chain reputation informs decisions, lenders provide capital when risk is assessed properly. The missing piece: scaling uncollateralized lending to individuals.

## 5. Social Trust Goes On-Chain

Decentralized social protocols brought persistent identity and verifiable trust to crypto. Farcaster (1M+ users)[[17]](#ref17) and Bluesky (20M+ users)[[18]](#ref18) created on-chain identities tied to real social graphs, activity history, and portable reputations. For the first time, we can quantify trust at scale: who vouches for you, who you vouch for, your repayment history across protocols—all transparent, verifiable, composable. Banks don't have social graphs; traditional DeFi doesn't have persistent identity. Combining both unlocks a new form of credit underwriting.

## The Convergence

Platform lenders proved cashflow-based underwriting works, but traditional financial rails keep costs high. Crypto infrastructure offers the same underwriting at 50-70% lower operational cost: instant stablecoin settlement vs. ACH delays, global capital pools earning 4-8% vs. VC equity demanding 20%+, programmable repayment vs. manual reconciliation. Result: 8-15% APR to borrowers (vs. 20-50% APR), global permissionless access, portable reputation, transparent on-chain credit history. Same underwriting model, different infrastructure, better economics—that's why now.
