# Loan Form Friction Analysis & Simplified Proposal

## Current Friction Points

### 1. **Too Many Textarea Fields** ❌
**Current proposal:**
- Personal story (150-1000 chars)
- Experience (50-500 chars)
- Business description (200-1500 chars)
- Loan use details (100-1000 chars)
- Expected impact (100-800 chars)
- Repayment confidence (100-600 chars)

**Total:** 6 separate essay fields, 600-5400 characters of writing

**Problem:**
- Intimidating amount of writing (5-20 minutes just typing)
- High cognitive load deciding what goes in each field
- Mobile users will abandon
- Duplicative information across fields

### 2. **Redundant with Farcaster Profile** ❌
**What we're asking for manually:**
- "Tell us about yourself"
- "Your experience"
- Personal background

**What we already have:**
- Farcaster username, display name, bio
- Profile picture
- Follower/following count
- Neynar reputation score
- Social proximity to lenders

**Problem:** Why ask users to re-tell who they are when we can display their Farcaster profile?

### 3. **Traditional Banking Interrogation** ❌
**Fields that feel like TradFi:**
- Monthly income/revenue (even though optional)
- Other financial obligations
- Business stage dropdown
- Repayment confidence essay

**Problem:**
- Goes against crypto-native, trustless ethos
- We have on-chain wallet activity analysis already
- Feels invasive and bureaucratic
- Users might lie anyway

### 4. **Photo Requirement Blocks Users** ⚠️
**Current:** Required field, can't submit without photo

**Problem:**
- Mobile users might not have good photos ready
- Creates immediate barrier to submission
- Some people are camera-shy or privacy-conscious
- Kiva shows 35% improvement, but that's correlation not causation

### 5. **Character Minimums Create Anxiety** ❌
**Examples:**
- Personal story: minimum 150 characters
- Business description: minimum 200 characters
- Loan use details: minimum 100 characters

**Problem:**
- Psychological barrier: "I need to write at least 150 characters"
- Users count characters instead of telling authentic stories
- Arbitrary minimums don't guarantee quality

### 6. **Purpose Dropdown + Story = Redundant** ❌
**Current:** Select category from dropdown (8 options) + write detailed description

**Problem:** If they're writing a detailed story, the dropdown category is redundant (can be auto-tagged)

## What We Already Have (Don't Need to Ask)

| Traditional Lenders Ask | We Have Instead |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Credit score | On-chain wallet activity score (walletActivity.ts) |
| Government ID | Farcaster verified account |
| Personal background | Farcaster profile (bio, pfp, username) |
| Social proof | Social proximity score + mutual connections |
| Income verification | Wallet transaction history |
| Character references | Follower/following graph |
| Photo of borrower | Farcaster profile picture (can use as fallback) |

## Simplified Proposal: 3-Section Form

### Section 1: Loan Details (2 minutes)

#### 1.1 How much do you need?
- **Type:** Number input
- **Validation:** $100 - $10,000 USDC
- **Required**

#### 1.2 How long to repay?
- **Type:** Dropdown
- **Options:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 weeks
- **Required**

#### 1.3 Give your loan a clear title
- **Type:** Text input
- **Max:** 80 characters
- **Placeholder:** "Buying sewing machine to expand tailoring business"
- **Required**
- **Helper text:** "Make it specific. Good: 'Laptop for freelance design work' | Bad: 'Need money'"

**Total:** 3 fields, ~1 minute

---

### Section 2: Your Story (5-10 minutes)

#### 2.1 Tell your story and how you'll use this loan
- **Type:** Textarea (rich text optional)
- **Suggested length:** 300-1500 characters (~2-3 paragraphs)
- **NO minimum enforced** - but show guidance
- **Placeholder:**
  ```
  Share your story in your own words. Great stories include:
  - Who you are and what you're working on
  - Exactly how you'll use this loan (be specific with numbers)
  - What this will help you achieve
  - Why you're confident you can repay

  Example:
  "I'm a freelance graphic designer who needs a new laptop. My current one is 8 years old and crashes constantly, forcing me to turn down projects. I'll use this $1,500 to buy a refurbished MacBook Pro ($1,400) and Adobe subscription ($100). This will let me take on 3-5 more clients per month, earning an extra $1,200/month. I currently make $2,500/month from design work, so the $187 bi-weekly payment is only 7% of my income. I can easily repay in 8 weeks."
  ```
- **Required**
- **Live character counter** (no minimum warning, just show count)
- **Expandable tips:**
  ```
  💡 What makes a great story?
  ✅ Specific numbers and details
  ✅ Clear breakdown of how you'll use funds
  ✅ Your background and why this matters
  ✅ Confidence about repayment

  ❌ Avoid:
  ❌ Vague requests: "need money for business"
  ❌ No specifics: "buy some equipment"
  ❌ All feelings, no facts
  ```

**Why this works:**
- ONE flexible field instead of 6 rigid ones
- Users can structure their story naturally
- No anxiety about which section to put what info
- Still captures all necessary info (who, what, why, how much, repayment confidence)
- No minimum = less pressure, but guidance encourages detail

**Total:** 1 field, 5-10 minutes

---

### Section 3: Add a Photo (Optional) (2 minutes)

#### 3.1 Photo of you and your project
- **Type:** Image upload with crop
- **Optional but strongly encouraged**
- **Banner message:**
  ```
  📸 Loans with photos get funded 35% faster
  Show yourself and what you're working on - lenders want to see the person behind the request.
  ```
- **Fallback:** If no photo uploaded, use Farcaster profile picture as loan card image
- **Skip button:** "I'll add a photo later" (can edit after submission)

**Why this works:**
- Doesn't block submission
- Clear incentive to add photo (35% faster funding)
- Fallback to Farcaster pfp means loan card always has an image
- Can add/update later

**Total:** 1 field, optional, ~2 minutes if used

---

### Section 4: Review & Submit (1 minute)

#### 4.1 Preview card
- Shows how loan will appear to lenders
- Displays Farcaster profile info automatically
- Shows social proximity badge (if connected wallet has Farcaster)

#### 4.2 Terms acknowledgment
- ☐ All information is truthful
- ☐ I understand this is 0% interest, bi-weekly repayments
- ☐ I commit to repaying to maintain my reputation
- ☐ Loan details are public on blockchain

**Total:** 1 checklist, ~30 seconds

## Comparison: Old vs. New

| Metric | Original Proposal | Simplified Proposal | Reduction |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Sections** | 7 | 4 | -43% |
| **Required fields** | 15+ | 5 | -67% |
| **Textarea fields** | 6 | 1 | -83% |
| **Min characters** | 600+ | 0 (guidance only) | -100% |
| **Estimated time** | 15-20 min | 5-10 min | -50% |
| **Completion rate** | ~60% (estimate) | ~85% (estimate) | +25% |

## What We Remove & Why It's OK

### ❌ Removed: Personal Story (separate field)
**Why it's OK:** Farcaster profile shows who they are + combined story field lets them introduce themselves

### ❌ Removed: Experience (separate field)
**Why it's OK:** Can mention in combined story if relevant; not always necessary

### ❌ Removed: Business Description (separate field)
**Why it's OK:** Combined into single story field; not everyone has a "business"

### ❌ Removed: Expected Impact (separate field)
**Why it's OK:** Can include in story; "what this will help me achieve"

### ❌ Removed: Business Stage dropdown
**Why it's OK:** Irrelevant for many loans; can infer from story

### ❌ Removed: Monthly Income field
**Why it's OK:**
- Wallet activity analysis shows on-chain financial activity
- Users might lie
- Can mention income in story if it strengthens their case

### ❌ Removed: Primary Income Source dropdown
**Why it's OK:** Can describe in story if relevant

### ❌ Removed: Repayment Confidence essay
**Why it's OK:** Can address in main story; don't need separate essay

### ❌ Removed: Other Financial Obligations question
**Why it's OK:**
- Feels like TradFi interrogation
- Users might not disclose honestly
- Wallet activity shows on-chain obligations (other loans)

### ❌ Removed: Loan Purpose Category dropdown
**Why it's OK:**
- Can infer category from title + story
- Can add tags later with LLM classification
- Lenders care more about the story than the category

### ❌ Removed: Character minimums
**Why it's OK:**
- Quality > quantity
- Guidance + examples > hard minimums
- Pressure creates generic filler text

- **Hypothesis:** B will have 20% higher completion rate with similar story quality

### Test 2: Photo Required vs. Optional
- **A:** Photo required to submit
- **B:** Photo optional, fallback to Farcaster pfp, banner showing "35% faster funding"
- **Hypothesis:** B will have 30% higher completion rate, 10% lower time-to-fund

### Test 3: 6 Textareas vs. 1 Flexible Textarea
- **A:** Separate fields for personal story, business, loan use, impact, repayment
- **B:** One combined "Your Story" field with example structure
- **Hypothesis:** B will have 40% higher completion rate, similar quality scores from lenders

## Mobile-First Considerations

### Original Proposal Issues:
- 7 sections = lots of scrolling on mobile
- 6 textarea fields = switching keyboards, losing context

- Dropdown + separate description = redundant taps

### Simplified Proposal Benefits:
- 4 sections fit on 2-3 mobile screens
- 1 main textarea = stay in flow state
- Minimal UI clutter
- Can complete entire form without leaving page

### Mobile Optimizations:
- Single-column layout throughout
- Large tap targets (min 44×44px)
- Sticky "Save Draft" button at bottom
- Progress indicator: "2 of 4 sections complete"
- Auto-advance to next section on completion

---

## Final Simplified Form Spec

```typescript
interface LoanFormData {
  // Required
  amount: number;              // $100 - $10,000
  repaymentPeriod: number;     // 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 weeks
  title: string;               // max 80 chars
  story: string;               // suggested 300-1500 chars, no minimum

  // Optional
  imageUrl?: string;           // uploaded photo or null

  // Auto-populated
  borrowerAddress: `0x${string}`;
  farcasterFid?: number;
  createdAt: number;

  // Auto-calculated (don't ask user)
  category?: string;           // LLM-classified from title+story
  estimatedRisk?: string;      // Based on wallet activity + social proximity
}
```

**Total user input:** 4 required fields + 1 optional = 5 inputs vs. 15+ in original

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Completion Rate
- **Original:** ~60% (industry avg for long forms)
- **Simplified:** ~85% (+25%)
- **With AI assist:** ~95% (+35%)

### Time to Complete
- **Original:** 15-20 minutes
- **Simplified:** 5-10 minutes (-50%)
- **Mobile:** 8-12 minutes (vs. 25+ min with original)

### Loan Quality
- **Hypothesis:** Similar or better
- **Why:** Less pressure = more authentic stories
- **Why:** Guidance + examples > rigid structure
- **Why:** Quality borrowers will still provide detail

### Time to Fund
- **Original (with photo):** Baseline
- **Simplified (photo optional):** 5-10% slower (fewer photos initially)
- **After users add photos:** Returns to baseline
- **Net effect:** More loans listed → more total funded

---

## Conclusion

**Remove 67% of required fields without sacrificing quality by:**

1. ✅ **Trusting Farcaster profiles** - Don't ask what we already know
2. ✅ **One flexible story field** - Not 6 rigid essays
3. ✅ **Guidance over minimums** - Encourage, don't enforce
4. ✅ **Optional photos with incentive** - Don't block submission
5. ✅ **Remove TradFi questions** - Leverage on-chain data instead
6. ✅ **Mobile-first design** - 5-10 min completion on phone

**The mantra:** Every field we remove is a reason fewer people will abandon the form.

**The test:** Can you complete this form on your phone while standing in line at a coffee shop?
- Original: No (15-20 min, 6 essays)
- Simplified: Yes (5-10 min, 1 story + basics)
