# Risk Grades

## The A-HR Scale

Every loan gets a grade from A (minimal risk) to HR (very high risk).

**Note:** These grades and weights are initial parameters based on P2P lending research. We'll continuously refine the model and adjust parameters as we collect more repayment data.

## Grade Meanings

| Grade | Risk | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **A** 🟢 | Minimal | Excellent history + strong ties |
| **B** 🟢 | Low | Good history OR strong ties |
| **C** 🟡 | Moderate | Some history, moderate ties |
| **D** 🟡 | Elevated | Limited history or weak ties |
| **E** 🔴 | High | No history + large loan |
| **HR** 🔴 | Very High | High risk situation or recovery |

**Note on default rates:** Once we collect sufficient repayment data, we'll publish estimated default rates by grade to help lenders make informed decisions.

**How are these calculated?** See [Calculation](calculation.md) for the detailed scoring methodology.
