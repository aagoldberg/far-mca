## The A-HR Scale

Every loan gets a grade from A (minimal risk) to HR (very high risk).

## How Grades Are Calculated

Based on 4 weighted factors:

```
Grade = History (40%) + Social Trust (30%) + Loan Size (20%) + Quality (10%)

Total points (0-100) → Grade:
- 80-100 points = A
- 65-79 points = B
- 50-64 points = C
- 35-49 points = D
- 20-34 points = E
- 0-19 points = HR
```
