## Most Predictive Cash Flow Variables

### Deposits and Balances

> "Account deposits and balances were generally the most powerful variables."

### Additional Predictive Variables

> "Factors such as withdrawals, balance volatility, and low/negative balance incidents were also predictive."

### Typical Model Features

> "Models typically use 10 to 20 features covering areas such as low or negative balance events, stability of cash inflows, balance trend over time, number and amount of recent cash outflows, and debt-to-income proxies."

### Specific Metrics Used

**Liquidity Indicators:**

> "The current ratio (balance divided by median monthly outflow) and expense-to-income ratio (median outflow divided by median inflow) quantified cash flow adequacy."

[Source: FinRegLab Research](https://finreglab.org/research/the-use-of-alternative-data-in-underwriting-credit/)

**Behavioral Features:**

> "Transactional activity was quantified through recency, frequency, and ticket size, while affluence was inferred from the number of large purchases."

## Model Performance Findings

### Cash Flow vs. Traditional Credit Scores

> "The predictiveness of the cash-flow scores and attributes was generally at least as strong as the traditional credit scores and credit bureau attributes studied."

[Source: FinRegLab Fact Sheet](https://finreglab.org/research/fact-sheet-cash-flow-data-in-underwriting-credit/)

### Combined Models

> "Models that added cash-flow variables to personal credit scores and other traditional inputs predicted default risk more accurately across all borrower segments analyzed."

[Source: PRNewswire - Small Business Lending Study](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/finreglab-study-shows-cash-flow-data-can-expand-small-business-lending-302472352.html)

### Machine Learning + Cash Flow (Best Performer)

> "Across all models built for the study, the machine model that combined credit bureau data with cash flow data was the most predictive overall and across all subgroups. It also had the highest approval rates overall and for most subgroups at most risk thresholds."

### ML Outperforms Traditional Methods

> "Machine learning models substantially outperformed traditional logistic regression methods across all types of data (cash flow data only, credit bureau data only, or both sources combined)."

## Approval Rate Impact

### Quantified Improvement

> "Machine learning models increased credit approvals by approximately 4% compared to traditional logistic regression at risk cutoffs used by mainstream lenders."

### Real-World Translation

> "This translates to roughly 2 million additional credit card accounts and 152,000 extra mortgages annually (based on 2023 origination volumes)."

### No Increase in Default Risk

The study found that these approval increases came "without increasing lenders' default risk" and with "relatively low false positive rates (approvals of consumers who went on to default)."

## Where Cash Flow Data Helps Most

### Target Populations

> "Gains were particularly large for low-score entrepreneurs whose businesses are less than five years old."

[Source: PRNewswire - Small Business Lending Study](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/finreglab-study-shows-cash-flow-data-can-expand-small-business-lending-302472352.html)

### Specific Beneficiaries

> "The effects are larger for low-score owners whose businesses are young (less than five years old). The results suggest that adopting cash-flow data could be particularly important in increasing lenders' confidence when underwriting financially constrained business owners that have historically been considered high risk."

[Source: FinRegLab Sharpening the Focus](https://finreglab.org/research/sharpening-the-focus-using-cash-flow-data-to-underwrite-financially-constrained-businesses/)

### Subpopulation Analysis

> "When divided into subgroups based on likely race, ethnicity, and gender, the degree to which the cash-flow data predicted credit risk appeared to be relatively consistent across subpopulations."

[Source: FinRegLab Empirical Research Findings](https://finreglab.org/research/the-use-of-cash-flow-data-in-underwriting-credit-empirical-research-findings/)

### Not a Proxy for Demographics

> "The cash-flow data appeared to provide independent predictive value across all groups rather than acting as proxies for demographic group."

## Market Context

### Credit Gap

> "An estimated 45 to 60 million consumers lack sufficient credit history to generate reliable credit scores."

[Source: FinRegLab Empirical Research Findings](https://finreglab.org/research/the-use-of-cash-flow-data-in-underwriting-credit-empirical-research-findings/)

### Bank Account Penetration

> "More than 96 percent of American households have bank or prepaid accounts."

[Source: FinRegLab Fact Sheet](https://finreglab.org/research/fact-sheet-cash-flow-data-in-underwriting-credit/)

### Traditional Lender Populations

> "Among participating lenders where data was available, the percentage of borrowers with traditional credit scores below about 650 was approximately 45 to 50 percent."

[Source: FinRegLab Fact Sheet](https://finreglab.org/research/fact-sheet-cash-flow-data-in-underwriting-credit/)

### Small Business Impact

> "Small businesses created two out of every three net new jobs over fifteen years, yet racial minorities, recent immigrants, and women face particular challenges in accessing credit."

## Data Sources for Small Business Underwriting

> "Use of electronic cash-flow data was originally pioneered by fintechs that used electronic bank account records, accounting software feeds, and payment records to facilitate faster underwriting of smaller loans to small business owners."

[Source: FinRegLab Small Business Spotlight](https://finreglab.org/research/the-use-of-cash-flow-data-in-underwriting-credit-small-business-spotlight/)

### Specific Data Types

| Data Source | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Bank account records | Deposit/withdrawal history, balances |
| Accounting software feeds | QuickBooks, Xero, etc. |
| E-commerce transaction data | Shopify, Amazon, eBay sales |
| Payment processor data | Stripe, Square, PayPal transactions |

## Application to Shopify/Stripe/Square Data

Based on FinRegLab's validated findings, the following metrics from e-commerce platforms map to proven predictive variables:

| Platform Data | FinRegLab-Validated Metric | Predictive Value |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Total revenue | Deposit/inflow levels | "Most powerful" |
| Revenue trend | Balance trend over time | Predictive |
| Transaction count | Transaction frequency | Predictive |
| Average order value | Ticket size | Predictive |
| Revenue variance | Balance volatility | Predictive |
| Refund rate | Outflow patterns | Predictive |
| Success rate | Cash flow stability | Predictive |
| Time on platform | Account tenure | Predictive |
| MRR (Stripe) | Income stability | Predictive |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cash flow data is at least as predictive as traditional credit scores** for default risk.

2. **Combined models (cash flow + traditional) outperform either alone** across all borrower segments.

3. **Machine learning further improves performance** when combined with cash flow data.

4. **The biggest gains are for underserved populations**: low credit scores, young businesses, thin-file borrowers.

5. **No fair lending concerns**: cash flow data provides independent predictive value, not demographic proxies.

6. **E-commerce data (Shopify, Stripe, Square) maps directly** to the validated cash flow variables.
