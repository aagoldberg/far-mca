# Trust Cascades

## How Social Vouching Creates Funding Momentum

Trust cascades describe how early contributions from close connections create confidence that attracts broader funding. This mirrors traditional lending: you ask family first, then friends, then acquaintances, then institutions.

## The Three-Stage Progression

### Stage 1: Core Network
**Who:** Close friends, family (🟢 LOW RISK scores)

Early contributors with strong social ties provide the initial validation. They contribute small amounts ($10-$50) immediately and stake their social reputation.

---

### Stage 2: Extended Network
**Who:** Friends-of-friends, acquaintances (🟡 MEDIUM RISK scores)

After seeing core network validation, the extended network contributes moderate amounts ($20-$100). They trust the judgment of mutual connections.

**Information Cascade**

When Alice (well-connected member) funds $30, others infer: "Alice knows the borrower and trusts them. I'll contribute too."
{% endhint %}

---

### Stage 3: Public Lenders
**Who:** Strangers with zero connections (🔴 HIGH RISK scores)

Public lenders rely on **proxy signals** to decide:
- What's the loan's support strength? (🟢 STRONG is best)
- Did well-connected people fund early?
- How many lenders know the borrower?

Without strong social validation, public funding rarely happens.

## Why It Works

When someone contributes, they're doing two things:

1. **Providing capital** - Direct financial support
2. **Vouching for you** - Staking their social reputation

**Key Principle**

A $10 contribution from a close friend (🟢 LOW RISK) is a **stronger trust signal** than $100 from a stranger (🔴 HIGH RISK).

## Research Foundation

{% hint style="success" %}
**Feigenberg et al. (2013)**

"Increased meeting frequency in lending groups builds social capital and improves repayment by creating persistent social ties and information sharing."

Group lending works because early repayers create trust cascades that encourage later borrowers.

## Why Trust Cascades Work

**Peer Monitoring:** Group members monitor each other, reducing moral hazard.

**Social Sanctions:** Defaulting damages relationships with everyone who funded, not just anonymous lenders.

**Information Cascades:** Early endorsements influence subsequent lenders.

**Threshold Effects:** Once ~30-40% funded by connected lenders, public funding accelerates.

## Example: Complete Trust Cascade

Sarah needs $500 for car repair. Here's how her loan funds:

### Hour 1: Core Network (30% funded)
- 4 close friends contribute $25-50 each → $150 total
- Support Strength: 100% 🟢 **STRONG**

### Hour 6: Extended Network (65% funded)
- 5 acquaintances see validation, contribute $20-50 each → $175 more
- Support Strength: Still 100% 🟢 **STRONG**

### Hour 24: Public Lenders (100% funded)
- 3 strangers see 🟢 STRONG support, contribute $50-75 each → $175 more
- Final Support Strength: 75% 🟢 **STRONG** (9/12 lenders know Sarah)

{% hint style="success" %}
Public lenders funded **because** the loan had 🟢 STRONG support. Without early validation, they wouldn't have contributed.
{% endhint %}

## Best Practices

### For Borrowers
✅ Share with close friends first (DM or private group)
✅ Ask for small amounts ($10-25 from 10 people)
✅ Provide clear context in loan metadata
✅ Update early lenders on progress

### For Lenders
✅ Fund early if you know the borrower (signals confidence)
✅ Follow support strength (🟢 STRONG loans are safer)
✅ Diversify ($10 to 10 loans > $100 to 1 loan)
