# Trust Cascades

## How Social Vouching Creates Funding Momentum

Trust cascades describe how early contributions from close connections create confidence that attracts funding from extended networks and eventually public lenders.

This mirrors traditional lending: you ask family first, then friends, then acquaintances, then institutions.

## The Natural Progression

### Stage 1: Core Network (High Trust, Early Risk)

**Who:** Close friends, family, tight community members

**Risk Tier:** 🟢 LOW RISK (trust scores 60-100)

**Contribution Pattern:**
- Small to moderate amounts ($10-$50)
- Contribute immediately when loan is posted
- Strong social accountability

**Why They Fund:**
- Personal relationship with borrower
- Direct knowledge of borrower's situation
- Social pressure to support friends

{% hint style="success" %}
**Trust Signal Strength: Very High**

When your core network funds, they're putting their social reputation on the line. This is the strongest possible endorsement.
{% endhint %}

---

### Stage 2: Extended Network (Medium Trust, Validation Seeking)

**Who:** Friends-of-friends, acquaintances, broader community

**Risk Tier:** 🟡 MEDIUM RISK (trust scores 30-59)

**Contribution Pattern:**
- Moderate amounts ($20-$100)
- Contribute after seeing core network validation
- Check loan metadata and early lender profiles

**Why They Fund:**
- See that close friends have already funded
- Trust the judgment of mutual connections
- Minimal personal risk ($20-50 typical)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Information Cascade Effect**

When extended network sees that Alice (well-connected community member) funded $30, they infer: "Alice knows the borrower well and trusts them. I'll contribute too."

This is called an **information cascade**—early decisions influence later decisions.
{% endhint %}

---

### Stage 3: Public Lenders (Low/No Trust, Confidence from Support Strength)

**Who:** Strangers with zero mutual connections

**Risk Tier:** 🔴 HIGH RISK (trust scores 0-29)

**Contribution Pattern:**
- Larger amounts ($50-$200)
- Contribute after loan has 🟢 **STRONG** support strength
- Diversify across multiple loans

**Why They Fund:**
- Loan already has strong social validation
- Support strength signals low default risk
- Altruistic giving or portfolio diversification

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Key Insight: Public Lenders Rely on Social Validation**

Public lenders don't know the borrower personally, so they use **proxy signals**:
- How many lenders have social connections?
- Did well-connected people fund early?
- What's the loan's support strength?

Without these signals, public funding rarely happens.
{% endhint %}

## How Contributions Signal Trust

When someone contributes to your loan, they're doing two things simultaneously:

### 1. Providing Capital
Direct financial support to reach funding goal.

### 2. Vouching for You
Staking their social reputation and signaling trustworthiness to others.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Key Principle**

A $10 contribution from a mutual friend with 🟢 LOW RISK is a **stronger trust signal** than $100 from a stranger with 🔴 HIGH RISK.

Amount matters, but social proximity matters more for trust.
{% endhint %}

## Economic Signaling Theory

Contributions have two dimensions:

### Financial Signal

| Signal Type | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Amount contributed** | Financial commitment level |
| **Early contributions** | Willingness to take risk before validation |
| **Full funding** | Community confidence reached critical mass |

---

### Social Signal

| Signal Type | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Proximity to borrower** | Closer connections = stronger endorsement |
| **Contributor's reputation** | Well-connected lenders add more credibility |
| **Network overlap** | Multiple lenders from same network = coordinated trust |

---

## Research Foundation

{% hint style="success" %}
**Feigenberg et al. (2013)**

"Increased meeting frequency in lending groups builds social capital and improves repayment by creating persistent social ties and information sharing."

Group lending works because **repeated interactions** create trust cascades where early repayers encourage later borrowers.

## Trust Cascade Mechanics

### Why Trust Cascades Work

#### 1. Peer Monitoring
Group members monitor each other's behavior, reducing moral hazard. If Alice funded your loan, she's incentivized to check in on your progress.

#### 2. Social Sanctions
Network connections create enforcement through reputation damage. Defaulting hurts your relationship with everyone who funded, not just anonymous lenders.

#### 3. Information Cascades
Early endorsements by trusted connections influence subsequent lenders. When Bob sees that Alice (who has 50 mutual friends) funded $30, Bob infers Alice has private information about creditworthiness.

#### 4. Threshold Effects
Once a loan reaches ~30-40% funding from connected lenders, public funding accelerates rapidly. The "tipping point" signals sufficient social validation.

## Example: Complete Trust Cascade

### Loan Request
- **Borrower:** Sarah
- **Amount:** $500
- **Purpose:** Emergency car repair
- **Network:** 200 close connections on Farcaster

---

### Hour 1: Core Network (0% → 30% funded)

| Lender | Mutual | Risk Tier | Amount | Running Total |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Alice (best friend) | 120 | 🟢 LOW | $50 | $50 (10%) |
| Bob (family) | 95 | 🟢 LOW | $40 | $90 (18%) |
| Charlie (roommate) | 88 | 🟢 LOW | $35 | $125 (25%) |
| Dave (close friend) | 62 | 🟢 LOW | $25 | $150 (30%) |

**Support Strength:** 4/4 = 100% → 🟢 **STRONG**

---

### Hour 6: Extended Network (30% → 65% funded)

| Lender | Mutual | Risk Tier | Amount | Running Total |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Eve (friend of Alice) | 18 | 🟡 MEDIUM | $30 | $180 (36%) |
| Frank (community member) | 12 | 🟡 MEDIUM | $40 | $220 (44%) |
| Grace (acquaintance) | 8 | 🟡 MEDIUM | $25 | $245 (49%) |
| Henry (met once) | 5 | 🟡 MEDIUM | $30 | $275 (55%) |
| Iris (mutual group) | 9 | 🟡 MEDIUM | $50 | $325 (65%) |

**Support Strength:** 9/9 = 100% → 🟢 **STRONG** (still)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Information Cascade Active**

Eve funded because she saw Alice (her close friend) fund. Frank funded because he saw 4 people with strong connections already funded. Each decision reinforces the next.
{% endhint %}

---

### Hour 24: Public Lenders (65% → 100% funded)

| Lender | Mutual | Risk Tier | Amount | Running Total |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Jack (stranger) | 0 | 🔴 HIGH | $75 | $400 (80%) |
| Kelly (stranger) | 0 | 🔴 HIGH | $50 | $450 (90%) |
| Liam (stranger) | 0 | 🔴 HIGH | $50 | $500 (100%) |

**Support Strength:** 9/12 = 75% → 🟢 **STRONG**

{% hint style="success" %}
**Trust Cascade Complete**

Public lenders funded **because** the loan had 🟢 STRONG support (75% of lenders know Sarah). Without early validation from Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave, Jack/Kelly/Liam likely wouldn't have contributed.
{% endhint %}

---

## What Happens Without Trust Cascades?

### Scenario: No Core Network Funding

If Sarah's loan got **zero** contributions from her network:

| Hour | Lender | Mutual | Amount | Support Strength |
|------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Stranger A | 0 | $100 | 0% ⚪ NONE |
| 6 | Stranger B | 0 | $50 | 0% ⚪ NONE |
| 24 | — | — | — | $150 (30%) |

**Result:** Loan stalls at 30% funding. Public lenders see ⚪ **NONE** support strength and don't contribute.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Insight**

Loans without early network validation **rarely reach full funding**.

If your own friends won't vouch for you, why should strangers?

## Best Practices for Borrowers

### Maximize Your Trust Cascade

✅ **Share with close friends first** (via direct message or private group)

✅ **Ask for small contributions** ($10-25 from 10 people = $100-250 quickly)

✅ **Provide clear context** in loan metadata (why you need it, when you'll repay)

✅ **Update early lenders** as you reach milestones (50%, 75%, 100% funded)

✅ **Thank contributors publicly** (builds social reciprocity)

---

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Posting publicly first** - Your core network might miss it

❌ **Only asking close friends** - They might not have capital; extend to broader network

❌ **No context** - Even friends want to know what the money is for

❌ **Going silent** - Keep lenders updated, even if it's just "30% funded, thank you!"

---

## Best Practices for Lenders

### Amplify Trust Cascades

✅ **Fund early if you know the borrower** - Your contribution signals confidence

✅ **Contribute visibly** - Public contributions encourage others

✅ **Share with your network** - "I just funded Sarah's loan, here's why..."

✅ **Follow support strength** - 🟢 STRONG loans are safer

✅ **Diversify contributions** - $10 to 10 loans > $100 to 1 loan

## Network Effects at Scale

As LendFriend grows, trust cascades become more powerful:

### Phase 1: Small Network (Current)
- ~50-200 active users
- Trust cascades within tight communities
- Most loans require 5-10 lenders

### Phase 2: Medium Network (6-12 months)
- ~1,000-5,000 active users
- Trust cascades across multiple communities
- Cross-network funding becomes common
- Reputation history starts mattering

### Phase 3: Large Network (1-2 years)
- ~50,000+ active users
- Global trust cascades
- Loans fund in hours instead of days
- Strong borrower reputation = instant funding

{% hint style="info" %}
**Network effects are exponential**

With N users, there are N² potential connections. As the network grows:
- More lenders can fund any given borrower
- Trust cascades propagate faster
- Public lenders have more validation signals
{% endhint %}

## Comparison to Traditional Lending

| Traditional | LendFriend Trust Cascades |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Credit score (private) | Social trust score (public) |
| Bank decision (opaque) | Community decision (transparent) |
| Fixed interest rate | 0% interest (Phase 1) |
| Collateral required | Social collateral only |
| No reputation visibility | All history on-chain |
| Single lender | Crowdfunded by network |
| Impersonal | Personal connections matter |
