# Borrower Profiles & Identity

## Why Borrower Profiles Work

People don't lend to statistics—they lend to people. Research shows donors give significantly more to an identified individual with a story than to statistical information about a group [[11]](../references.md#small-et-al-2007). This is the **identifiable victim effect**: we connect emotionally with specific people, not abstract numbers.

Kiva has funded $1.68B+ by helping lenders feel connected to real stories—Armenian bakers, Moroccan bricklayers, actual people with faces and plans. Neural research shows that positive arousal from viewing borrower photographs directly predicts lending success [[12]](../references.md#genevsky-and-knutson-2015). Emotional storytelling increases donations by up to 70% compared to statistics alone.

**LendFriend's approach:** Borrowers create profiles with photos, personal stories, and specific loan purposes. But unlike Kiva (strangers across the world) or Prosper (anonymous profiles), your friends see your request first. They're not just evaluating a pitch—they're vouching for someone they actually know. This transforms emotional connection into social accountability.

## What Borrowers Share

### Your Face

A photo humanizes your request. Research shows borrowers appearing trustworthy receive better terms [[1]](../references.md#duarte-et-al-2012), but the real impact is emotional: faces create connection. When your friends contribute, they're putting their reputation on the line for someone they recognize.

### Your Story

Who are you? A DAO contributor with irregular income? A freelancer growing your business? Someone facing unexpected expenses? Personal narratives help lenders understand your context and feel empathy. Stories stimulate oxytocin—the hormone that creates feelings of trust and generosity.

**What resonates:** Honest, specific stories. "I'm a freelance designer who just lost my biggest client and need to cover rent while I find new work."

**What doesn't:** Over-promising. Borrowers making many "trustworthy" claims had worse repayment [[2]](../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011). Lenders sense authenticity.

### Your Plan

What will you do with the money? Specific purposes create emotional engagement. "Purchasing $500 of fabric to fulfill holiday orders" lets lenders visualize the impact. Vague requests ("need money for business") don't create that connection [[2]](../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011).

### Your Presence (Optional)

Link your website, Twitter, ongoing work. Active online presence signals legitimacy [[4]](../references.md#freedman-and-jin-2017) and lets lenders see you're a real person with a real business.

## The Social Vouching Difference

**Traditional crowdfunding (Kiva, GoFundMe):** Emotional stories to attract stranger donations. High empathy, but no accountability mechanism beyond platform ratings.

**Traditional P2P (Prosper, LendingClub):** Anonymous profiles optimize for algorithmic scoring. Low emotional connection, strangers evaluating strangers.

**LendFriend:** Your friends see your story first. When they contribute, they're vouching for you with their money and reputation. This combines emotional connection (faces, stories, specific needs) with social accountability (your actual friends are watching).

Misrepresenting yourself doesn't just hurt an anonymous rating—it damages relationships with people who know you. And lenders see that your friends believed in you enough to contribute first.

Research shows social proximity reduces default risk by 13% [[6]](../references.md#karlan-et-al-2009). Add the emotional connection from personal stories, and the friend vouching mechanism creates something powerful: lending based on trust, not just data.

## Why This Matters

Traditional lending fails because:
- **Credit scores** miss context (why you need money, your real situation, your character)
- **Statistics** don't create emotional connection (donors give less to numbers than to people)
- **Strangers** can't judge trustworthiness as well as friends

LendFriend succeeds because:
- **Faces and stories** create emotional connection and empathy
- **Specific needs** help lenders visualize impact and feel engaged
- **Friend vouching** transforms emotional connection into social accountability
- **Cryptographic social graphs** (Farcaster) make connections verifiable

Research shows combining emotional narratives with social network validation improves default prediction by 45% compared to credit scores alone [[3]](../references.md#iyer-et-al-2016)—not just because of information, but because emotional connection + social accountability changes behavior.
