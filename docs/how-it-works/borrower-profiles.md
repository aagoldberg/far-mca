# Borrower Profiles & Identity

## Why Borrower Profiles Work

People don't lend to statistics—they lend to people.

{% hint style="info" %}
Kiva funded $1.68B+ by connecting lenders to real stories. Neural research shows positive arousal from borrower photographs directly predicts lending success [[12]](../references.md#genevsky-and-knutson-2015). Emotional storytelling increases donations by 70% compared to statistics [[11]](../references.md#small-et-al-2007).

**LendFriend's approach:** Your friends see your request first. When they contribute, they vouch for someone they know—transforming emotional connection into social accountability.

## What Borrowers Share

**Your face:** Photos create emotional connection. When friends contribute, they vouch for someone they recognize [[1]](../references.md#duarte-et-al-2012).

**Your story:** Honest, specific narratives resonate. "I'm a freelance designer who just lost my biggest client" works. Over-promising doesn't—borrowers making many "trustworthy" claims had worse repayment [[2]](../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011).

**Your plan:** Specific purposes let lenders visualize impact. "Purchasing $500 of fabric for holiday orders" engages. Vague requests ("need money for business") don't [[2]](../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011).

**Your presence (optional):** Link your website, social media, ongoing work. Active online presence signals legitimacy [[4]](../references.md#freedman-and-jin-2017).

## How Social Vouching Works

Kiva and GoFundMe prove emotional storytelling attracts funding. LendFriend adds a layer: **your friends see your request first**.

When they contribute, they vouch with money and reputation. Misrepresenting yourself damages real relationships.

**The impact:**
- Social proximity reduces default risk by 13% [[6]](../references.md#karlan-et-al-2009)
- Emotional narratives + social validation improve default prediction by 45% vs. credit scores [[3]](../references.md#iyer-et-al-2016)
- Borrowers who tip on repayment (5-10% extra) signal financial health and strengthen reputation for future loans
