# Borrower Profiles & Identity

## Why Personal Information Matters

LendFriend uses both hard information (verifiable credit data) and soft information (personal narratives, photos, business descriptions) to help lenders make decisions. Combining both types improves default prediction by **45%** compared to credit scores alone [[3]](../references.md#iyer-et-al-2016).

## What Borrowers Share

### Profile Picture

Your face humanizes the loan request. Borrowers who appear trustworthy receive better terms—about 50 basis points lower interest rates [[1]](../references.md#duarte-et-al-2012). But here's the key difference from platforms like Prosper: when your friends contribute, they're vouching for both your story and your picture. Misrepresenting yourself doesn't just hurt an anonymous rating—it damages relationships with people who actually know you.

### About You

Tell lenders who you are. Are you a DAO contributor with irregular income? A freelancer growing your business? Someone hit by unexpected expenses? Personal narratives help lenders understand context that credit scores can't capture [[5]](../references.md#liberti-and-petersen-2018).

**What works:** Honest, specific stories about your situation.
**What doesn't:** Over-promising. Borrowers making many "trustworthy" claims actually had worse repayment rates [[2]](../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011). Lenders learn to spot this.

### About This Loan

What will you use the money for? What will it help you achieve?

Clear, specific purposes work better than vague ones. "Purchasing $500 of fabric to fulfill holiday orders" beats "need money for business." Specificity helps lenders assess legitimacy and shows you've thought this through [[2]](../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011).

Kiva has funded $1.68B+ with 96.3% repayment by helping lenders feel connected to real stories—Armenian bakers, Moroccan bricklayers, actual people with actual plans.

### Business Information (Optional)

Link your website, Twitter, or other active accounts. Verifiable social network information helps predict repayment beyond credit scores [[4]](../references.md#freedman-and-jin-2017). Active online presence signals legitimacy and ongoing operations.

Multiple verified platforms increase trust—covered more in [Social Trust Scoring](social-trust-scoring/README.md).

## How This Changes Lending

### Friends Know You Better Than Credit Scores

In traditional P2P lending (Prosper, LendingClub), lenders are strangers evaluating anonymous profiles. There's no social cost to exaggerating or misrepresenting—just an algorithm score.

LendFriend works differently. Your friends see your loan request first. When they contribute, they're putting their reputation on the line. This creates accountability to people whose opinion you actually care about. Social proximity reduces default risk by 13% [[6]](../references.md#karlan-et-al-2009)—and that's just the start.

### Lenders Screen More Effectively

When evaluating your loan, lenders look for:

- **Consistency**: Does your story match your social profile?
- **Specificity**: Real plans vs vague promises
- **Authenticity**: Are you being genuine or over-selling?

Combining your narrative with your social connections, lenders can screen more accurately than any credit score alone [[3]](../references.md#iyer-et-al-2016).
