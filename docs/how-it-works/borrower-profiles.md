# Borrower Profiles & Identity

## Why Borrower Profiles Work

People don't lend to statistics—they lend to people. Research shows donors give significantly more to an identified individual with a story than to statistical information [[11]](../references.md#small-et-al-2007). This is the **identifiable victim effect**: we connect emotionally with specific people, not abstract numbers.

Kiva funded $1.68B+ by connecting lenders to real stories. Neural research shows positive arousal from borrower photographs directly predicts lending success [[12]](../references.md#genevsky-and-knutson-2015). Emotional storytelling increases donations by 70% compared to statistics.

**LendFriend's approach:** Borrowers create profiles with photos, stories, and specific loan purposes. Unlike Kiva (strangers) or Prosper (anonymous profiles), your friends see your request first and vouch for someone they know. This transforms emotional connection into social accountability.

## What Borrowers Share

### Your Face

A photo humanizes your request. Research shows borrowers appearing trustworthy receive better terms [[1]](../references.md#duarte-et-al-2012), but the real impact is emotional—faces create connection. When friends contribute, they vouch for someone they recognize.

### Your Story

Personal narratives help lenders understand your context and feel empathy. Honest, specific stories resonate ("I'm a freelance designer who just lost my biggest client"). Over-promising doesn't—borrowers making many "trustworthy" claims had worse repayment [[2]](../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011).

### Your Plan

Specific loan purposes create emotional engagement. "Purchasing $500 of fabric for holiday orders" lets lenders visualize impact. Vague requests ("need money for business") don't [[2]](../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011).

### Your Presence (Optional)

Link your website, Twitter, ongoing work. Active online presence signals legitimacy [[4]](../references.md#freedman-and-jin-2017).

## The Social Vouching Difference

**Traditional crowdfunding (Kiva, GoFundMe):** Emotional stories attract stranger donations. High empathy, minimal accountability.

**Traditional P2P (Prosper, LendingClub):** Anonymous profiles optimize for algorithms. Low emotional connection, strangers evaluating strangers.

**LendFriend:** Friends see your story first. When they contribute, they vouch with money and reputation. This combines emotional connection with social accountability—misrepresenting yourself damages relationships with people who know you.

Social proximity reduces default risk by 13% [[6]](../references.md#karlan-et-al-2009). Combining emotional narratives with social network validation improves default prediction by 45% compared to credit scores [[3]](../references.md#iyer-et-al-2016)—because emotional connection + social accountability changes behavior.

## Why This Matters

Traditional lending fails because credit scores miss context and strangers can't judge trustworthiness as well as friends.

LendFriend succeeds because:
- **Faces and stories** create emotional connection
- **Specific needs** help lenders visualize impact
- **Friend vouching** transforms empathy into social accountability
- **Cryptographic social graphs** (Farcaster) make connections verifiable
