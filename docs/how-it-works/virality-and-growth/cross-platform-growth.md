## How It Works

Every loan gets a shareable web page: `lendfriend.org/loan/[loan-id]`

**Borrowers share to 12+ platforms:**
- Twitter/X
- WhatsApp
- Telegram
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Email
- Discord
- Farcaster
- Bluesky
- Reddit
- TikTok
- Snapchat

**Anyone can view and donate** without Farcaster, crypto wallets, or blockchain knowledge.

**The flow:**
1. Borrower creates loan on Farcaster
2. LendFriend generates public webpage
3. Borrower shares to multiple platforms
4. Non-crypto friends click link
5. View loan page and contribute
6. New lenders discover other loans
7. Some become borrowers (K-factor > 1)

## Removing Barriers for Non-Crypto Users

**Web3 adoption barriers** [[14]](../../references.md#web3-adoption-2024):
- Only 42% of internet users own or have owned cryptocurrency
- 40% abandon wallet setup due to complexity
- $930M lost to key management issues in 2024
- Seed phrases and private keys confuse users

**LendFriend's solution:**
- Social login via Privy (Google, email, social accounts)
- Wallet infrastructure for web users is currently an open question
- Progressive disclosure: contribute first, learn crypto later (optional)
- Users never need to understand wallets, seed phrases, or blockchain

## The Viral Loop

**How cross-platform sharing compounds growth:**

1. Farcaster users create loans via mini apps
2. Share to Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.
3. Non-crypto friends see shareable pages
4. Donate via web without Farcaster account
5. New lenders discover platform and other loans
6. Some new lenders become borrowers
7. Each borrower brings more lenders (K > 1)

**Result:** Growth expands beyond Farcaster from day 1, reaching billions of non-crypto users through familiar platforms.
