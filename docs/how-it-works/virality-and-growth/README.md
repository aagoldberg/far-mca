## Why Start with Farcaster?

**1. Strongest Trust Signals**
- Wallet-based identity (unforgeable)
- Quality filtering removes bots/spam
- Real relationships in crypto community

**2. Crypto-Native Users**
- Already understand wallets, on-chain transactions
- No onboarding friction

**3. Built for Virality**
- Mini apps run inside posts (no external clicks)
- Cast Actions enable one-tap contributions
- Open social graph API for instant Trust Scores

When Farcaster launched mini apps (evolved from Frames), DAU jumped 10× in two weeks [[13]](../../references.md#farcaster-frames-2024).

**4. Solves Cold Start**
- Borrowers bring their own lenders (friends)
- Each loan introduces new lenders
- Trust Scores make strangers comfortable funding

## Growth Mechanisms

### Farcaster Native

Mini apps enable full web experiences inside Farcaster posts. Users discover loans in their feed, view Trust Scores, and contribute—all without leaving Farcaster.

- Telegram
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Email
- Discord
- Farcaster
- Bluesky
- Reddit
- And more...

**Anyone can donate:**

- Credit card → USDC conversion
- Mobile-optimized, 4-field form
- No crypto knowledge needed

→ [See conversion optimization and mobile design](cross-platform-growth.md)

### Viral Funding Principles

Research-backed mechanisms that make loans spread:
- First 10 days critical [[11]](../../references.md#crowdfunding-first-10-days)
- 70% = tipping point for completion
- Stories increase funding 78% [[2]](../../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011)
- Trust cascades: friends → network → strangers

### Platform Scaling

Network effects drive exponential growth when K-factor > 1:
- Kiva: 0 → 800K lenders via referrals [[16]](../../references.md#kiva-prosper-growth)
- Prosper: 300K → 800K through incentives [[16]](../../references.md#kiva-prosper-growth)
- P2P market: $209B → $1T by 2032 [[15]](../../references.md#p2p-market-2024)
