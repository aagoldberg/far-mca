# 🚀 Virality & Growth

LendFriend starts on Farcaster, then expands to Bluesky, Twitter/X, and beyond.

## Why Start with Farcaster?

**1. Strongest Trust Signals**
- Wallet-based identity (unforgeable)
- Quality filtering removes bots/spam
- Real relationships in crypto community

**2. Crypto-Native Users**
- Already understand wallets, on-chain transactions
- No onboarding friction

**3. Built for Virality**
- Mini apps run inside posts (no external clicks)
- Cast Actions enable one-tap contributions
- Open social graph API for instant Trust Scores

When Farcaster launched mini apps (evolved from Frames), DAU jumped 10× in two weeks [[13]](../../references.md#farcaster-frames-2024).

**4. Solves Cold Start**
- Borrowers bring their own lenders (friends)
- Each loan introduces new lenders
- Trust Scores make strangers comfortable funding

## Four Growth Mechanisms

### [1. Viral Funding Mechanics](viral-funding-mechanics.md)

Research-backed principles:
- First 10 days critical [[11]](../../references.md#crowdfunding-first-10-days)
- 70% = tipping point for completion
- Stories increase funding 78% [[2]](../../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011)
- Trust cascades: friends → network → strangers

### [2. Farcaster Virality](farcaster-virality.md)

Platform features that eliminate friction:
- Mini apps = full web experiences inside posts
- Cast Actions = one-tap funding
- Open social graph for real-time Trust Scores

### [3. Cross-Platform Growth](cross-platform-growth.md)

Reaching non-crypto users:
- Shareable pages (Twitter, Telegram, WhatsApp)
- Social login (Google/email)
- Mobile-optimized (62% traffic [[12]](../../references.md#gofundme-conversion-2024))
- 4-field forms = 120% conversion boost [[12]](../../references.md#gofundme-conversion-2024)

Only 42% own crypto [[14]](../../references.md#web3-adoption-2024)—we meet users where they are.

### [4. Platform Scaling](platform-scaling.md)

Network effects drive exponential growth:
- Kiva: 0 → 800K lenders [[16]](../../references.md#kiva-prosper-growth)
- Prosper: 300K → 800K via referrals [[16]](../../references.md#kiva-prosper-growth)
- P2P market: $209B → $1T by 2032 [[15]](../../references.md#p2p-market-2024)

When K-factor > 1, growth compounds without paid acquisition.
