# Virality & Growth

Loans spread through social networks. Borrowers share requests with friends, friends vouch with money and reputation, and each successful loan creates advocates who share success stories.

## Why Loans Go Viral

{% hint style="success" %}
**Research shows:**
- First 10 days are critical—early contributions trigger participation cascades [[11]](../../references.md#crowdfunding-first-10-days)
- 70% funding = psychological tipping point for completion [[11]](../../references.md#crowdfunding-first-10-days)
- Emotional storytelling increases donations by 70% [[11]](../../references.md#small-et-al-2007)
- Social proximity reduces default risk by 13% [[6]](../../references.md#karlan-et-al-2009)
{% endhint %}

**How it works:**

Borrower creates loan → Friends contribute first → Extended network sees activity → Strangers join at 70%+ → Loan completes → Success stories spread

Each loan introduces new lenders. Some lenders become borrowers. The cycle compounds.

## How to Share

**On Farcaster:**

Mini apps let users view loan details, Trust Scores, and contribute—all inside their feed. No external clicks, no wallet connecting. Funding is as easy as liking a post.

**Everywhere else:**

Every loan gets a shareable web page: `lendfriend.org/loan/[loan-id]`

Share to Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more. Anyone can contribute via web using social login and credit card—no crypto knowledge needed.

## The Growth Loop

1. Borrowers bring their own lenders (friends)
2. Lenders discover other loans on the platform
3. Some lenders become borrowers
4. Each borrower brings more lenders
5. Network effects compound

**Goal:** Each user brings 1+ new users for exponential growth.
