## How Individual Loan Requests Spread Through Networks

Research shows loan requests spread through three mechanisms: social proof cascades, emotional storytelling, and trust-based networks.

## Key Research Findings

### The First 10 Days Are Critical

Research shows **early contributions trigger participation cascades** [[11]](../../references.md#crowdfunding-first-10-days):

- Social sharing is **most effective in the first 10 days**
- Early donors signal quality to later contributors
- Campaigns without early momentum **rarely succeed**
- **70% of goal = tipping point** for completion

If a campaign does not reach 70% after 20 days, it is unlikely to succeed.

**Why this matters:**
1. Observational learning - People believe the project is worthwhile
2. Word-of-mouth - Early backers tell connections
3. Helpful feedback - Creators adjust based on early response

## Emotional Storytelling Drives Funding

**Research: "Tell Me a Good Story and I May Lend You Money"** [[2]](../../references.md#herzenstein-et-al-2011)

Study of P2P lending narratives found:
- **Identity claims** in stories increase funding
- **78% of lenders** prefer funding borrowers with compelling stories
- Personal connection to borrower's situation drives contributions

**Effective loan request elements:**

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Clear purpose** | People fund goals, not abstractions |
| **Relatable situation** | Creates emotional connection |
| **Specific amount** | Shows planning and responsibility |
| **Repayment plan** | Signals trustworthiness |
| **Authenticity** | Builds trust (overstated claims reduce trust) |

## Trust Cascades

Social trust creates a natural funding progression:

**Stage 1: Close friends** (High Trust Score)
- Small amounts ($20-$100)
- First 24 hours
- Validate the loan request

**Stage 2: Extended network** (Medium Trust Score)
- Medium amounts ($50-$200)
- Days 2-5
- Leverage social proof from Stage 1

**Stage 3: Platform users** (Low Trust Score)
- Larger amounts ($100-$500)
- Days 5-30
- Validated by early lenders

This mirrors traditional lending: family first, then friends, finally institutions.

## The 70% Threshold

Potential donors are **more likely to contribute late in a campaign if more than 70% of the goal has been reached** [[11]](../../references.md#crowdfunding-first-10-days).

| Funding Progress | Psychological Signal | Lender Behavior |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 0-30% | High risk, unvalidated | Only close friends |
| 30-50% | Some validation | Extended network evaluates |
| 50-70% | Building momentum | Strangers start considering |
| **70-90%** | **Tipping point** | **Participation accelerates** |
| 90-100% | Near completion, FOMO | Final rush |

## What Makes Loans Go Viral

**1. Emotional Resonance**
- Personal stories outperform generic requests
- Relatable situations spread faster
- Authenticity matters

**2. Social Validation**
- Display Trust Scores
- Show mutual friends who contributed
- Highlight early lenders

**3. Easy Sharing**
- One-click share to multiple platforms
- Pre-written share text
- Trackable referral links

**4. Urgency & Scarcity**
- Funding deadlines create FOMO
- "80% funded" signals momentum
- "Only $500 left" drives action

## Key Takeaways

**Viral Funding Principles:**

1. **First 10 days determine success** - Early contributions signal quality
2. **70% = tipping point** - Reaching this threshold accelerates completion
3. **Stories > Numbers** - 78% of lenders prefer compelling narratives
4. **Trust cascades work** - Close friends → extended network → strangers
5. **Social proof compounds** - Each contribution makes the next easier

Research shows these principles work across Kiva (800K lenders [[16]](../../references.md#kiva-prosper-growth)), Prosper (800K members [[16]](../../references.md#kiva-prosper-growth)), and crowdfunding platforms globally.
