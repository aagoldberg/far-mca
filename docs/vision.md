# Vision

> **Imagine a world where your reputation replaces your credit score, your cashflow replaces collateral, and loans repay themselves automatically from your wallet.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**What We're Building**

LendFriend is uncollateralized lending in crypto. No need to lock up $150 to borrow $100. No credit checks. No collateral requirements that exclude most people.

**The Promise:** Trust verified by your network + cashflow verified by APIs + repayment automated by smart contracts.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Why This Matters**

Uncollateralized lending expands who can access crypto, funds real economic activity, and brings new people into the ecosystem.

## The Journey

### Phase 0: Prove Trust Works (Testnet Now → 2025)

**Status:** Live on Base Sepolia Testnet

**What:** 0% interest loans backed purely by social signals

**Where:** Farcaster mini apps (launching on mainnet soon)

**How it works:**
1. Borrow $100-$5,000 from your network
2. Your Trust Score comes from real relationships and on-chain reputation
3. Repay on your own schedule—no interest, just trust
4. Build reputation through timely repayment and optional tipping

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Why Start Here**

We need to prove that uncollateralized lending works when reputation is at stake. Farcaster gives us crypto-native users who understand wallets, strong social signals from real relationships, and a community that will give us honest feedback.
{% endhint %}

**Goal:** 500-1,000 users demonstrating that social accountability can replace collateral.

### Phase 1: Scale with Cashflow (2025-2026)

**Status:** Planned

**What:** Larger loans using social signals + verified cashflow data

**New Capabilities:**
- Larger loan amounts ($5K-$50K+)
- Bank account cashflow verification (Plaid)
- Small business revenue verification (Square, Shopify)
- Cross-platform sharing (website, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram)
- **Liquidity pools** for passive lenders

{% hint style="success" %}
**The Key Shift**

Cashflow verification transforms lending from **"I trust my friend"** to **"I trust the data"**.

With objective cashflow data:
- Lenders don't need to personally know borrowers
- Anonymous capital can fund loans through pools
- Passive investors earn yields without active loan selection
- Liquidity scales beyond personal networks
{% endhint %}

**Technical Foundation:**

**Data Sources:**
- **Plaid** — Bank account cashflow verification
- **Square/Shopify** — Merchant revenue and sales data
- **On-chain** — Wallet transaction history

**Risk Model:** Hybrid approach combining:
- Social trust (weighted lower for large loans)
- Cashflow verification (weighted higher for large loans)
- Repayment history (most predictive signal)

**Goal:** Serve borrowers traditional finance excludes—freelancers, crypto-native workers, small merchants.

### Phase 2: Automate Repayment (2026-2027)

**Status:** Future

**What:** Loans that repay themselves automatically from your wallet or business revenue

**The Vision:**

**Step 1:** Get approved based on social trust + verified cashflow

**Step 2:** Choose "auto-repay from my Square sales" or "auto-deduct from my wallet"

**Step 3:** As you earn, small amounts automatically flow to lenders

**Step 4:** No payment reminders, no stress, no late fees

**Step 5:** Just passive repayment as your business grows

### For Merchants (Easier, Shipping First)

**Square Integration:**
- Open APIs available today
- Revenue share model: 2-5% of daily sales auto-repays loan
- As merchant earns, loan repays itself

**Shopify Integration:**
- Currently harder (requires ACH rails)
- Shopify moving toward crypto wallets aggressively

### For Wallet Holders (Developing)

**Account Abstraction:**
- Payment streams plugins maturing
- Auto-deduct from incoming stablecoin transfers
- Stripe + Coinbase pushing crypto wallet adoption

**When Wallets Receive Income:**
- Loan auto-deducts configured percentage
- No manual transfers
- Seamless repayment

{% hint style="success" %}
**Why This Matters**

Removes the biggest friction in P2P lending—**remembering to repay**.

Borrowers never miss payments. Lenders get passive, predictable returns. Lower default rates for everyone.
{% endhint %}

**Goal:** Make uncollateralized lending feel invisible—you borrow, you earn, it repays itself.

## Why This Works Now

Five years ago, this wasn't possible. Today, the infrastructure exists:

| Infrastructure | What It Enables |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Open Social Graphs** | Calculate trust without invasive API permissions (Farcaster, Bluesky) |
| **Stablecoin Adoption** | USDC on Base: fast, cheap, stable payments |
| **Cashflow Data APIs** | Verify income without traditional employment (Plaid, Square, Shopify) |
| **Account Abstraction** | Programmable wallets with payment streams and auto-deduction |
| **On-Chain Reputation** | ENS, POAPs, DAO participation captures crypto-native work |

> **The pieces exist. We're assembling them into something new.**

## What Makes This Hard (And Achievable)

<details>
<summary><strong>Challenge 1: Auto-deduction tech isn't mature yet</strong></summary>

**Solution:**
- Start with Square (open APIs available today)
- Wait for Shopify/wallet infrastructure to catch up
- Shopify is aggressively moving to crypto wallets
- Account abstraction developing fast
- We build the model now, tech catches up soon

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Challenge 2: Cashflow attestations are complex</strong></summary>

**Options by difficulty:**
- **Easiest:** Direct API integrations (Plaid, Square) — Ship first
- **Medium:** Chainlink oracles for bank data — Add later
- **Harder:** Zero-knowledge proofs (zkTLS, Reclaim Protocol) — Future privacy layer

**Solution:** Start with easy integrations, layer in privacy later

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Challenge 3: Consumer wallet onboarding</strong></summary>

**Solution:**
- Privy social login (Google, email) for web users
- Farcaster users already have wallets
- Progressive disclosure: contribute first, learn crypto later

</details>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**We're not waiting for perfect infrastructure.**

We're building with what exists today and upgrading as the ecosystem matures.
