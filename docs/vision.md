# Vision

## The Future We're Building

**Imagine a world where your reputation replaces your credit score, your cashflow replaces collateral, and loans repay themselves automatically from your wallet.**

LendFriend is building uncollateralized lending in crypto. No need to lock up $150 to borrow $100. No credit checks. No collateral requirements that exclude most people. No late payment stress.

Just trust, verified by your network and your business activity—repaying seamlessly in the background as you earn.

Uncollateralized lending expands who can access crypto, funds real economic activity, and brings new people into the ecosystem. This is where LendFriend is going.

## The Journey

### **Phase 0: Prove Trust Works** (Testnet Now → 2025)

**What:** 0% interest loans backed purely by social signals

**Where:** Farcaster mini apps (launching on mainnet soon)

**How it works:**
- Borrow $100-$5,000 from your network
- Your Trust Score comes from real relationships and on-chain reputation
- Repay on your own schedule—no interest, just trust
- Build reputation through timely repayment and optional tipping

**Why start here:** We need to prove that uncollateralized lending works when reputation is at stake. Farcaster gives us crypto-native users who understand wallets, strong social signals from real relationships, and a community that will give us honest feedback.

**Goal:** 500-1,000 users demonstrating that social accountability can replace collateral.

### **Phase 1: Scale with Cashflow** (2025-2026)

**What:** Larger loans using social signals + verified cashflow data

**New capabilities:**
- Larger loan amounts ($5K-$50K+)
- Bank account cashflow verification (Plaid)
- Small business revenue verification (Square, Shopify)
- Cross-platform sharing (website, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram)
- **Liquidity pools** for passive lenders

**Why cashflow matters:** Social trust works for small loans, but larger amounts need more signal. Traditional credit scores are outdated and exclusionary. Cashflow is a better proxy—it shows actual income, not past debt. This unlocks lending for gig workers, DAO contributors, and small businesses that banks ignore.

**Why pools become possible:** With verified cashflow data, risk assessment becomes more objective and less dependent on social relationships. This means:
- Lenders don't need to personally know borrowers
- Anonymous capital can fund loans through pools
- Passive investors can earn yields without active loan selection
- Liquidity scales beyond personal networks

Cashflow verification transforms lending from "I trust my friend" to "I trust the data"—enabling traditional liquidity pool mechanics.

**Technical foundation:**
- **Plaid** for bank account cashflow
- **Square/Shopify APIs** for merchant revenue data
- Social signals remain important, but weighted lower as amounts increase
- Hybrid model: trust + cashflow = accurate risk assessment

**Goal:** Serve borrowers traditional finance excludes—freelancers, crypto-native workers, small merchants.

### **Phase 2: Automate Repayment** (2026-2027)

**What:** Loans that repay themselves automatically from your wallet or business revenue

**The vision:**
1. Get approved for a loan based on social trust + verified cashflow
2. Choose "auto-repay from my Square sales" or "auto-deduct from my wallet"
3. As you earn, small amounts automatically flow to lenders
4. No payment reminders, no stress, no late fees
5. Just passive repayment as your business grows

**Technical approach:**

**For merchants (easier, shipping first):**
- **Square** has open APIs—we can integrate auto-deduction today
- Revenue share model: 2-5% of daily sales auto-repays loan
- As merchant earns, loan repays itself
- **Shopify** currently harder (requires ACH rails), but they're moving toward crypto wallets aggressively

**For wallet holders (developing):**
- **Account abstraction** is maturing fast—"payment streams" plugins coming
- **Stripe** working on crypto wallet integrations
- **Coinbase** pushing stablecoin ecommerce payments
- When wallets receive income, loan auto-deducts
- No manual transfers, just seamless repayment

**Why this matters:** Removes the biggest friction in P2P lending—remembering to repay. Borrowers never miss payments. Lenders get passive, predictable returns. Everyone wins.

**Goal:** Make uncollateralized lending feel invisible—you borrow, you earn, it repays itself.

## Why This Works Now

Five years ago, this wasn't possible. Today, the infrastructure exists:

**1. Open Social Graphs**
- Farcaster, Bluesky: public relationship data
- Can calculate trust without invasive API permissions

**2. Stablecoin Adoption**
- USDC on Base: fast, cheap, stable
- Ecommerce platforms adding crypto payments
- Wallets becoming mainstream

**3. Cashflow Data APIs**
- Plaid, Square, Shopify APIs are mature
- Can verify income without traditional employment

**4. Account Abstraction**
- Programmable wallets coming to market
- Payment streams, auto-deduction plugins
- Smart accounts that can "set it and forget it"

**5. On-Chain Reputation**
- ENS, POAPs, DAO participation verifiable
- Captures crypto-native work traditional systems miss

The pieces exist. We're assembling them into something new.

## What Makes This Hard (And Achievable)

**Challenge 1: Auto-deduction tech isn't mature yet**
- **Solution:** Start with Square (open APIs), wait for Shopify/wallet infrastructure to catch up
- Shopify is aggressively moving to crypto wallets
- Account abstraction developing fast
- We build the model now, tech catches up soon

**Challenge 2: Cashflow attestations are complex**
- **Easiest:** Direct API integrations (Plaid, Square)
- **Medium:** Chainlink oracles for bank data
- **Harder:** Zero-knowledge proofs (zkTLS, Reclaim Protocol)
- **Solution:** Start with easy integrations, layer in privacy later

**Challenge 3: Consumer wallet onboarding**
- **Solution:** Privy social login (Google, email) for web users
- Farcaster users already have wallets
- Progressive disclosure: contribute first, learn crypto later

**We're not waiting for perfect infrastructure. We're building with what exists today and upgrading as the ecosystem matures.**

## The Path Forward

**Today (Testnet):** Proving social trust works with 0% interest loans

**2025:** Launch on mainnet, grow to 1,000 users, gather repayment data

**2025-2026:** Add website, cashflow verification, liquidity pools, scale to larger loans

**2026-2027:** Integrate auto-deduction with Square, experiment with wallet streams, make repayment invisible

**Beyond:** Multi-platform expansion, institutional pool liquidity, portable credit scores across DeFi
