# Vision

> **Imagine a world where your reputation replaces your credit score, your cashflow replaces collateral, and loans repay themselves automatically from your wallet.**

{% hint style="info" %}
**🚀 What We're Building**

LendFriend is uncollateralized lending in crypto. No need to lock up $150 to borrow $100. No credit checks. No collateral requirements that exclude most people.

**The Promise:** Trust verified by your network + cashflow verified by APIs + repayment automated by smart contracts.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**💡 Why This Matters**

Uncollateralized lending expands who can access crypto, funds real economic activity, and brings new people into the ecosystem.

## 🗺️ The Journey

### 🧪 **Phase 0: Prove Trust Works** (Testnet Now → 2025)

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Live%20on%20Testnet-success)

**What:** 0% interest loans backed purely by social signals

**Where:** Farcaster mini apps (launching on mainnet soon)

**📋 How it works:**
1. 💸 Borrow $100-$5,000 from your network
2. 📊 Your Trust Score comes from real relationships and on-chain reputation
3. ✅ Repay on your own schedule—no interest, just trust
4. ⭐ Build reputation through timely repayment and optional tipping

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Why Start Here**

We need to prove that uncollateralized lending works when reputation is at stake. Farcaster gives us crypto-native users who understand wallets, strong social signals from real relationships, and a community that will give us honest feedback.
{% endhint %}

**🎯 Goal:** 500-1,000 users demonstrating that social accountability can replace collateral.

### 📊 **Phase 1: Scale with Cashflow** (2025-2026)

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Planned-blue)

**What:** Larger loans using social signals + verified cashflow data

**🆕 New Capabilities:**
- 💰 Larger loan amounts ($5K-$50K+)
- 🏦 Bank account cashflow verification (Plaid)
- 🏪 Small business revenue verification (Square, Shopify)
- 🌐 Cross-platform sharing (website, Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram)
- 🏊 **Liquidity pools** for passive lenders

{% hint style="success" %}
**💡 The Key Shift**

Cashflow verification transforms lending from **"I trust my friend"** to **"I trust the data"**.

With objective cashflow data:
- ✅ Lenders don't need to personally know borrowers
- ✅ Anonymous capital can fund loans through pools
- ✅ Passive investors earn yields without active loan selection
- ✅ Liquidity scales beyond personal networks
{% endhint %}

**🔧 Technical Foundation:**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Data Sources" %}
- **Plaid** → Bank account cashflow
- **Square/Shopify** → Merchant revenue
- **On-chain** → Wallet transaction history
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Risk Model" %}
**Hybrid approach:**
- Social trust (weighted lower for large loans)
- Cashflow verification (weighted higher)
- Repayment history (most predictive)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**🎯 Goal:** Serve borrowers traditional finance excludes—freelancers, crypto-native workers, small merchants.

### ⚡ **Phase 2: Automate Repayment** (2026-2027)

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Future-lightgrey)

**What:** Loans that repay themselves automatically from your wallet or business revenue

**🔮 The Vision:**

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | Get approved based on social trust + verified cashflow |
| 2️⃣ | Choose "auto-repay from my Square sales" or "auto-deduct from my wallet" |
| 3️⃣ | As you earn, small amounts automatically flow to lenders |
| 4️⃣ | No payment reminders, no stress, no late fees |
| 5️⃣ | Just passive repayment as your business grows |

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Merchants (Easier)" %}
**Square Integration:**
- ✅ Open APIs available today
- 💰 Revenue share model: 2-5% of daily sales auto-repays loan
- 📈 As merchant earns, loan repays itself

**Shopify Integration:**
- ⏳ Currently harder (requires ACH rails)
- 🚀 Shopify moving toward crypto wallets aggressively
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Wallets (Developing)" %}
**Account Abstraction:**
- 🔄 Payment streams plugins maturing
- ⚡ Auto-deduct from incoming stablecoin transfers
- 🔐 Stripe + Coinbase pushing crypto wallet adoption

**When Wallets Receive Income:**
- Loan auto-deducts configured percentage
- No manual transfers
- Seamless repayment
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Why This Matters**

Removes the biggest friction in P2P lending—**remembering to repay**.

- ✅ Borrowers never miss payments
- ✅ Lenders get passive, predictable returns
- ✅ Lower default rates for everyone
{% endhint %}

**🎯 Goal:** Make uncollateralized lending feel invisible—you borrow, you earn, it repays itself.

## ⚙️ Why This Works Now

Five years ago, this wasn't possible. Today, the infrastructure exists:

| Infrastructure | What It Enables |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 🌐 **Open Social Graphs** | Calculate trust without invasive API permissions (Farcaster, Bluesky) |
| 💵 **Stablecoin Adoption** | USDC on Base: fast, cheap, stable payments |
| 📊 **Cashflow Data APIs** | Verify income without traditional employment (Plaid, Square, Shopify) |
| 🔐 **Account Abstraction** | Programmable wallets with payment streams and auto-deduction |
| 💎 **On-Chain Reputation** | ENS, POAPs, DAO participation captures crypto-native work |

> **The pieces exist. We're assembling them into something new.**

## 🎯 What Makes This Hard (And Achievable)

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Challenge 1: Auto-deduction tech isn't mature yet</strong></summary>

**Solution:**
- Start with Square (open APIs available today)
- Wait for Shopify/wallet infrastructure to catch up
- Shopify is aggressively moving to crypto wallets
- Account abstraction developing fast
- We build the model now, tech catches up soon

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Challenge 2: Cashflow attestations are complex</strong></summary>

**Options by difficulty:**
- **Easiest:** Direct API integrations (Plaid, Square) → Ship first
- **Medium:** Chainlink oracles for bank data → Add later
- **Harder:** Zero-knowledge proofs (zkTLS, Reclaim Protocol) → Future privacy layer

**Solution:** Start with easy integrations, layer in privacy later

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Challenge 3: Consumer wallet onboarding</strong></summary>

**Solution:**
- Privy social login (Google, email) for web users
- Farcaster users already have wallets
- Progressive disclosure: contribute first, learn crypto later

</details>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**We're not waiting for perfect infrastructure.**

We're building with what exists today and upgrading as the ecosystem matures.
