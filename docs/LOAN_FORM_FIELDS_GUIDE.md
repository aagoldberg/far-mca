## Storytelling Best Practices

### The Kiva Formula

Kiva's most successful borrower stories follow this structure:

#### Personal Story (2 paragraphs):
1. **Opening hook:** Who you are + what you're passionate about
2. **Background:** Where you come from, what drives you
3. **Vision:** What you're working toward

**Example:**
> "I'm Maria, a single mother of two who's passionate about creating sustainable fashion. Growing up in a small town, I learned to sew from my grandmother and always dreamed of starting my own business. After years of working in retail, I finally took the leap and launched my online vintage clothing shop. My goal is to build a business that not only supports my family but also promotes eco-friendly fashion choices in my community."

#### Business Story (2-3 paragraphs):
1. **Origin:** When and why you started
2. **Current state:** Where the business is now
3. **Future plans:** Where it's headed with this loan

**Example:**
> "I started my vintage clothing shop six months ago from my living room. I source unique pieces from thrift stores and estate sales, then resell them online through Instagram and Depop. So far, I've made 50+ sales and built a loyal following of 500 customers who love sustainable fashion.
>
> Right now, I'm limited by my manual sewing machine. I can only alter about 5 pieces per week, which means I'm turning down orders. With an industrial sewing machine, I could triple my output and offer custom alterations as a new service.
>
> This loan will help me upgrade my equipment and expand from a side hustle to a real business. Within 6 months, I plan to hire a part-time assistant and move into a small studio space."

### Voice and Tone Guidelines

- **Use first person:** "I" and "we" create personal connection
- **Be specific:** Numbers, timelines, and details build credibility
- **Show passion:** Let your enthusiasm come through
- **Be honest:** Acknowledge challenges; lenders appreciate transparency
- **Future-focused:** Paint a picture of what success looks like
- **Keep it conversational:** Write like you're talking to a friend

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too vague:** "I need money to grow my business"
✅ **Specific:** "I need $1,200 to buy a sewing machine that will triple my production capacity"

❌ **All about the loan:** Focusing only on the money
✅ **Story-driven:** Explaining your journey and vision

❌ **Third person:** "The borrower is seeking funds..."
✅ **First person:** "I'm seeking $500 to..."

❌ **Negative tone:** "I'm desperate and out of options"
✅ **Positive tone:** "This is an exciting opportunity to take my business to the next level"

## Photo Guidelines

### What Makes a Great Loan Photo

Based on Kiva's guidelines and success data:

#### Must Include:
1. **You (the borrower):** Your face should be visible
2. **Your business/project:** Show what you're working on
3. **Context:** Give a sense of place and purpose

#### Technical Requirements:
- **Resolution:** At least 1200px wide
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 (will be cropped to this)
- **Lighting:** Bright, natural light preferred
- **Focus:** Sharp, not blurry

#### Composition Tips:

### Examples

**✅ Excellent Photos:**
1. Baker standing in kitchen with fresh bread on table, smiling at camera
2. Mechanic working on car engine with tools visible

**❌ Poor Photos:**

## Examples: Good vs. Bad

### Example 1: Graphic Designer Buying Laptop

#### ❌ BAD SUBMISSION

**Loan Title:** "Need laptop"

**Personal Story:** (120 characters - too short)
"I'm a designer and I need a new computer because my old one broke."

**Business Description:** (150 characters - too short)
"I do graphic design for clients. Business is going well. Need equipment upgrade."

**Loan Use Details:**
"Buy a MacBook Pro for design work."

**Photo:** Selfie with no business context

---

#### ✅ GOOD SUBMISSION

**Loan Title:** "Upgrading laptop to deliver faster turnarounds for design clients"

**Personal Story:** (380 characters)
"I'm Alex, a freelance graphic designer who's passionate about helping small businesses tell their stories through visual branding. After getting laid off during the pandemic, I taught myself design and started taking on freelance projects. Over the past year, I've built a client base of 15 local businesses who trust me with their logos, websites, and marketing materials. My goal is to turn this into a full-time career and eventually hire other designers."

**Business Description:** (520 characters)
"I launched my design business, Pixel & Purpose, 18 months ago from my apartment. I specialize in branding for sustainable and mission-driven small businesses. Currently, I work with 15 active clients and earn about $2,500/month in revenue. My services include logo design, website design, social media graphics, and print materials. I've completed over 60 projects with a 5-star rating on Upwork.

With better equipment, I can take on larger projects and deliver work faster. My vision is to become the go-to designer for eco-conscious brands in my region."

**Loan Use Details:** (280 characters)
"I'll use the $2,000 loan to:
- MacBook Pro M2 (refurbished): $1,600
- Adobe Creative Cloud annual subscription: $240
- External hard drive for backups: $100

**Photo:** Alex sitting at desk with current laptop open, design work visible on screen, smiling at camera, well-lit home office in background

### Example 2: Baker Buying Commercial Oven

#### ❌ BAD SUBMISSION

**Loan Title:** "Loan for business"

**Personal Story:** (80 characters - way too short)
"I bake cakes and cookies. I want to expand my business and make more money."

**Business Description:** (100 characters - too short)
"I sell baked goods. Started 6 months ago. Need a bigger oven to make more stuff."

**Loan Use Details:**
"Commercial oven - $3,000"

**Photo:** Just a photo of cupcakes (no borrower)

---

#### ✅ GOOD SUBMISSION

**Loan Title:** "Purchasing commercial oven to scale my home bakery into a catering business"

**Personal Story:** (450 characters)
"I'm Jordan, a self-taught baker who turned my love for baking into a thriving side business. I grew up watching my grandmother make traditional Caribbean pastries, and those memories inspired me to start Jordan's Sweet Treats six months ago. What began as selling cookies to friends has grown into a business with 20+ repeat customers and orders for birthday parties, weddings, and corporate events. My dream is to open a storefront bakery that celebrates Caribbean flavors."

**Business Description:** (680 characters)
"Jordan's Sweet Treats is a home-based bakery specializing in Caribbean-inspired desserts and custom cakes. I started it six months ago with just my home oven and $200 in initial supplies. Since then, I've served over 100 customers and generated $4,500 in revenue, with monthly sales growing 30% each month.

I currently work full-time as a nurse ($45,000/year salary), so I bake on evenings and weekends. My home oven can only produce 2 dozen cookies or 1 cake at a time, which limits me to about 10 orders per week.

With a commercial oven, I can quadruple my output and start accepting catering contracts. Within a year, I plan to transition to baking full-time."

**Loan Use Details:** (310 characters)
"I'll use the $3,500 loan for:
- Commercial convection oven (used): $2,800
- Installation and electrical work: $400
- Commercial baking sheets and pans: $200
- Upgraded mixer (KitchenAid Commercial): $100

This equipment will let me bake 4× more per batch and meet health code requirements for catering contracts."

**Expected Impact:** (290 characters)
"This oven will allow me to accept catering orders (minimum $500 each), which I currently have to turn down. I have 3 pending catering requests worth $2,100 total. With this loan, I can accept those orders, repay in 2 months, and build a catering client base to eventually quit my nursing job."

**Repayment Confidence:** (180 characters)
"I earn $3,750/month as a nurse, and my bakery brings in an additional $1,500/month. The bi-weekly payment of $175 is only 4% of my total income, so I'm very confident I can repay on time."

**Photo:** Jordan in apron, pulling a tray of cupcakes from the oven, smiling, with decorated cakes visible on counter in background, bright kitchen lighting

- Stronger community trust through transparency

This guide should be used as the foundation for implementing the loan creation form in LendFriend.
