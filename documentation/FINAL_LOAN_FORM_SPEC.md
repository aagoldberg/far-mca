### Section 2: About You (~3-5 minutes)

**4. Who are you and what do you do?**
- Type: Textarea
- Suggested length: 200-600 characters (~2-4 sentences)
- Required: Yes
- Warning threshold: <100 characters
- Purpose: Establish credibility and context

**Guidance:**
```
üí° Help lenders understand who you are:

Include (if relevant):
‚úÖ What you do for work or business
‚úÖ How long you've been doing it
‚úÖ Your relevant background or skills
‚úÖ Current situation (student, employed, entrepreneur, etc.)

Keep it concise:
‚úÖ 2-4 sentences is perfect
‚úÖ Focus on facts that build credibility
‚úÖ Mention income or client base if it helps your case

Avoid:
‚ùå Long personal history
‚ùå Irrelevant details
‚ùå Just "I need money"
```

**Example:**
"I'm Alex, a freelance graphic designer based in Austin. I've been doing design work for 2 years, specializing in branding for small businesses. I currently work with 8 active clients and earn about $2,500/month. Before freelancing, I worked at a marketing agency for 3 years."

---

### Section 3: This Loan (~5-8 minutes)

**5. What will you use this loan for?**
- Type: Textarea
- Suggested length: 150-500 characters
- Required: Yes
- Warning threshold: <75 characters
- Smart validation: Auto-sum numbers, warn if doesn't match loan amount

**Guidance:**
```
üí° Be specific with numbers:

‚úÖ Break down exactly what you'll buy
‚úÖ Include prices for each item
‚úÖ Numbers should add up to your loan amount
‚úÖ Explain WHY you need this

Format like:
- Item 1: $XXX
- Item 2: $XXX
- Item 3: $XXX
Total: $X,XXX
```

**Example:**
"I'll use the $1,500 to:
- Refurbished MacBook Pro M2: $1,400
- Adobe Creative Cloud (1 year): $100

My current laptop is 8 years old and crashes 2-3 times per day, which means I'm losing clients and can't meet deadlines."

---

**6. What will this help you achieve?**
- Type: Textarea
- Suggested length: 100-400 characters (~1-2 sentences)
- Required: Yes
- Warning threshold: <50 characters
- Purpose: Show impact and future plans

**Guidance:**
```
üí° Show the impact:

‚úÖ What changes after you get this loan?
‚úÖ Specific outcomes (more clients, higher revenue, new opportunities)
‚úÖ Numbers if possible (e.g., "2x my production", "+$500/month")

Keep it short:
‚úÖ 1-2 sentences is perfect
‚úÖ Focus on measurable impact
```

**Example:**
"This laptop will let me take on 3-5 more clients per month (currently turning them down). That's an extra $1,200-$1,500 in monthly revenue, which means I can repay this loan in 2 months and reinvest the rest into marketing."

---

**7. How will you repay this loan?**
- Type: Textarea
- Suggested length: 150-400 characters (~2-3 sentences)
- Required: Yes
- Warning threshold: <75 characters
- Purpose: Risk assessment and repayment capacity

**Guidance:**
```
üí° Show you can repay:

Include:
‚úÖ Your income source (job, business, freelance, etc.)
‚úÖ Approximate monthly income if comfortable sharing
‚úÖ Why the repayment is manageable for you
‚úÖ Any backup plans (savings, other income)

Calculate your payment:
Your loan: $X,XXX over Y weeks
Bi-weekly payment: $XXX

Examples:
‚úÖ "I work full-time earning $3,500/month. The $150 payment is only 8% of my income."
‚úÖ "My business generates $2,000/month in revenue. This $125 payment is manageable."
‚úÖ "I have steady freelance income of $1,800/month plus $2,000 in savings as backup."

Avoid:
‚ùå "I'll definitely pay back" (not specific)
‚ùå "Trust me" (no evidence)
```

**Example:**
"I earn $2,500/month from my design freelance work, with 8 active clients providing steady income. The bi-weekly payment of $187 is only 7.5% of my monthly income. I also have $3,000 in savings as a backup."

---

**8. Approximate Monthly Income (OPTIONAL)**
- Type: Dropdown select
- Required: No
- Purpose: Enable smart warnings, never displayed publicly

**Label:** "Approximate monthly income (optional)"

**Helper Text:**
"This helps us warn you if the repayment schedule might be challenging. We'll never display this publicly‚Äîonly you see it."

**Options:**
1. Prefer not to say
2. Less than $1,000/month
3. $1,000 - $2,000/month
4. $2,000 - $3,500/month
5. $3,500 - $5,000/month
6. $5,000 - $7,500/month
7. More than $7,500/month

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- ‚ùå NEVER displayed on loan card
- ‚ùå NEVER shown in loan details page
- ‚ùå NEVER exposed via public API
- ‚úÖ Only used for internal risk warnings
- ‚úÖ Encrypted in database
- ‚úÖ Only visible to borrower

**Smart Warnings (if provided):**

If bi-weekly payment > 25% of monthly income:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è This repayment schedule may be challenging

Your bi-weekly payment ($750) is 50% of your stated monthly income.
Most successful borrowers keep payments under 20% of income.

Suggestions:
- Extend timeline to 16 weeks ‚Üí $375 bi-weekly (25% of income)
- Reduce loan to $1,200 ‚Üí $300 bi-weekly (20% of income)

[Adjust Loan] [Continue Anyway]
```

If payment < 20% of monthly income:
```
‚úÖ This looks manageable!

Your bi-weekly payment ($250) is only 6% of your stated monthly income.
This is well within the recommended range.

üí° Tip: Mentioning this in your "repayment plan" above helps build lender confidence.
```
