## üîë Key Concepts

### Zero-Interest Model
LendFriend uses a zero-interest microloan model where:
- Funders contribute USDC to help businesses
- Businesses repay exactly 1.0x the contribution (no interest)
- Repayments happen in fixed periods (e.g., 12 months)
- All transactions are on-chain and transparent

### Migration from RBF
The integration plan covers migration from:
- **Old:** Revenue-Based Financing (1.5x repayment cap)
- **New:** Zero-Interest Microloans (1.0x repayment)

Key changes:
| Feature | Old | New |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Model | Campaign | Loan |
| Repayment | Revenue share % | Fixed periods |
| Cap | 1.5x | 1.0x |
| Terms | goalAmount, revenueShare | principal, termPeriods |
