# Migration from Installment to Flexible Repayment

## Branch Structure
- **`v1-installment-payments`**: Complex installment-based system (preserved)
- **`dev`**: Simplified flexible repayment system (active)

## Contract Comparison

### MicroLoan.sol

| Feature | Old (Installment) | New (Flexible) |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Lines of Code** | ~415 lines | ~335 lines |
| **Repayment Model** | Equal installments over periods | Flexible - any amount, anytime |
| **Due Dates** | Multiple (`firstDueDate + n * periodLength`) | Single `dueAt` timestamp |
| **Grace Period** | 7 days per payment | None - strict maturity |
| **Default Check** | Complex period calculation | `block.timestamp > dueAt` |
| **Parameters** | 11 immutables | 8 immutables |
| **Gas per Repay** | ~32-37k | ~18k (50% savings) |

#### Removed Fields
```solidity
// OLD - Removed
uint256 public immutable termPeriods;
uint256 public immutable periodLength;
uint256 public immutable firstDueDate;
uint256 public immutable gracePeriod;
uint256 public immutable suggestedWeeklyPayment;
uint256 public nextDuePeriodIndex;

// NEW - Simplified
uint256 public immutable dueAt;        // Single maturity date
uint256 public totalRepaid;            // Track cumulative repayments
```

#### Removed Functions
```solidity
// OLD
function perPeriodPrincipal() public view returns (uint256);
function currentDueDate() public view returns (uint256);
function defaultDeadline() public view returns (uint256);
function _applyToPrincipal(uint256, address) internal;

// NEW - Added
function secondsUntilDue() public view returns (uint256);
```

#### Simplified Events
```solidity
// OLD
event PeriodPaid(uint256 indexed periodIndex, uint256 amountPaid, uint256 dueDate, address indexed payer);
event LoanDefaulted(uint256 missedPaymentDate, uint256 periodsOverdue);

// NEW - Richer for off-chain tracking
event Repayment(
    address indexed payer,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 totalRepaid,
    uint256 outstanding,
    uint256 timestamp,
    uint256 secondsUntilDue
);
event Defaulted(uint256 dueDate, uint256 outstandingAmount, uint256 timestamp);
```

### MicroLoanFactory.sol

| Feature | Old (Installment) | New (Flexible) |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Parameters** | 7 (principal, term, period, firstDue, deadline, window, grace) | 5 (principal, duration, deadline, window) |
| **Bounds** | `minTermPeriods`, `maxTermPeriods`, `minPeriodLength`, `maxPeriodLength` | `minLoanDuration`, `maxLoanDuration` |

#### createLoan() Signature Change
```solidity
// OLD
function createLoan(
    address borrower,
    string calldata metadataURI,
    uint256 principal,
    uint256 termPeriods,           // Number of installments
    uint256 periodLength,          // Seconds per period
    uint256 firstDueDate,          // When first payment due
    uint256 fundraisingDeadline
) returns (address);

// NEW
function createLoan(
    address borrower,
    string calldata metadataURI,
    uint256 principal,
    uint256 loanDuration,          // Total seconds until maturity
    uint256 fundraisingDeadline
) returns (address);
```

## Example Usage Comparison

### Creating a $5,000 loan for 56 days

**OLD (Installment):**
```solidity
factory.createLoan(
    borrower,
    metadataURI,
    5_000e6,                    // $5,000
    8,                          // 8 installments
    7 days,                     // Weekly periods
    block.timestamp + 14 days,  // First payment in 14 days
    block.timestamp + 7 days    // Fundraising deadline
);
```

**NEW (Flexible):**
```solidity
factory.createLoan(
    borrower,
    metadataURI,
    5_000e6,                    // $5,000
    56 days,                    // Mature in 56 days
    block.timestamp + 7 days    // Fundraising deadline
);
```

### Repayment Flow

**OLD (Installment):**
- Borrower must pay ~$656/week ($5,250/8 periods)
- Each payment applies to next due period
- Missing a period triggers grace period countdown
- After grace expires, loan marked default
- Complex loop in `_applyToPrincipal()` to track periods

**NEW (Flexible):**
- Borrower can pay any amount, anytime
- All payments immediately reduce `outstandingPrincipal`
- UI suggests weekly amounts (calculated off-chain)
- Loan defaults immediately if unpaid at `dueAt`
- Simple subtraction, no loops
- **Overpayments distributed as bonus**: If borrower pays more than outstanding, excess goes to lenders pro-rata (no refund)

### Overpayment-as-Tip Feature

In the new system, borrowers can show appreciation to lenders by overpaying:

```solidity
// Example: $1,000 loan, borrower pays $1,500
loan.repay(1_500e6);

// Result:
// - outstanding = 0 (loan completed)
// - totalRepaid = $1,500
// - Lenders can claim 150% of their contribution
// - No refund to borrower
```

**Why this is useful for 0% interest microloans:**
- Encourages community goodwill
- Borrowers can voluntarily reward helpful lenders
- Creates positive feedback loop
- Simpler than refund logic (one transfer instead of two)

**Example scenario:**
1. Borrower gets $1,000 loan at 0% interest
2. Business succeeds, borrower pays back $1,200 (20% tip)
3. Each lender receives 120% of their contribution
4. Lender reputation improves, making future loans easier to fund

## Off-Chain Reputation Tracking

Since the contract is simpler, we track payment behavior off-chain by listening to events:

```typescript
// Listen to Repayment events
interface RepaymentEvent {
  payer: address;
  amount: bigint;
  totalRepaid: bigint;
  outstanding: bigint;
  timestamp: number;
  secondsUntilDue: number;
}

// Calculate suggested schedule adherence
function calculateReputation(loan: Loan, events: RepaymentEvent[]) {
  const duration = loan.dueAt - loan.fundedAt;
  const suggestedWeeklyPayment = loan.principal / (duration / (7 * 86400));

  let onTrackCount = 0;
  let behindCount = 0;

  events.forEach(event => {
    const elapsed = event.timestamp - loan.fundedAt;
    const weeksElapsed = elapsed / (7 * 86400);
    const expectedPaid = weeksElapsed * suggestedWeeklyPayment;

    if (event.totalRepaid >= expectedPaid) {
      onTrackCount++;
    } else {
      behindCount++;
    }
  });

  return {
    paymentsOnTime: onTrackCount,
    paymentsMissed: behindCount,
    avgDaysBetweenPayments: calculateAvgGap(events),
    paymentConsistency: calculateStdDev(events.map(e => e.amount)),
  };
}
```

## Benefits of New Approach

### ✅ Simplicity
- 80 fewer lines of contract code
- No complex period tracking logic
- Single maturity date (easy to understand)
- No grace period edge cases

### ✅ Gas Efficiency
- 50% gas savings per repayment (~18k vs ~32k)
- No loops during repayment
- Simpler state updates

### ✅ Flexibility
- Borrowers can repay on their own schedule
- Lump sum, weekly, or arbitrary amounts all work
- UI can suggest any payment schedule without changing contracts
- **Overpayments distributed as bonus**: Borrowers can "tip" lenders by paying more than principal (distributed pro-rata)

### ✅ Security
- Smaller attack surface
- Easier to audit (less code)
- Same security primitives (ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, Accumulator pattern)
- Token recovery for accidentally sent funds

### ✅ Community Engagement
- **Metadata updates**: Borrowers can post progress updates, thank you messages, and photos throughout loan lifecycle
- **Overpayment-as-tip**: Borrowers can voluntarily reward helpful lenders
- Rich events for off-chain reputation tracking

### ✅ Data Collection
- Rich events capture all payment behavior
- Off-chain analysis can test any scheduling hypothesis
- Can adjust UI suggestions based on learned patterns

## New Features (Community & Safety)

Beyond the simplification, we added four high-value features that enhance community engagement and safety:

### 1. Metadata Updates
```solidity
function updateMetadata(string calldata newMetadataURI) external onlyBorrower {
    require(active || completed, "loan not active or completed");
    require(bytes(newMetadataURI).length > 0, "empty metadata");
    metadataURI = newMetadataURI;
    emit MetadataUpdated(newMetadataURI, block.timestamp);
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Week 1: "Just opened my food cart! Here's a photo: ipfs://..."
- Week 4: "Hit $500 in sales this week, on track to repay early!"
- Completion: "Thank you lenders! You changed my life. Here's my story: ipfs://..."

### 2. Token Recovery (Safety)
```solidity
function recoverTokens(address token, address to) external nonReentrant {
    require(completed || cancelled, "loan still active");
    require(to != address(0), "invalid recipient");

    uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balance > 0, "no tokens to recover");

    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, balance);
}
```

Prevents funds from being permanently locked if someone accidentally sends tokens to a completed loan.

### 3. Comprehensive Status View
```solidity
function getStatus() external view returns (
    bool fundraisingActive,
    bool active,
    bool completed,
    bool cancelled,
    bool defaulted,
    uint256 percentFunded,    // basis points
    uint256 percentRepaid,    // basis points
    uint256 secondsUntilDue
);
```

Reduces frontend RPC calls from 8+ individual state reads to 1 single call.

### 4. Accumulator Finalization Fix
When loan completes with overpayment, accumulator is finalized to ensure 100% of funds (including tips) are distributable to lenders with no rounding dust.

## Rollback Plan

If the simplified system doesn't work, the original installment-based system is preserved in the `v1-installment-payments` branch:

```bash
# Switch back to installment system
git checkout v1-installment-payments

# Or cherry-pick specific commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

All tests, deployment scripts, and frontend code for the installment system remain intact on that branch.
