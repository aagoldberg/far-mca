## Proven Research (Empirically Validated)

### 1. Kiva Research: Social Connections Improve Repayment

**Source**: "Repayment behavior in peer-to-peer microfinancing: Empirical evidence from Kiva" (ScienceDirect, 2015)

**Key Findings**:
- Overall repayment rate: **98.78%** across 29,304 transactions (Feb 2011 - Oct 2013)
- Loan size and term significantly affect repayment performance
- Women make more ambitious effort to repay than men
- Group loans more risky up to size of seven members
- Social ties and team membership increase repayment likelihood

**Application to LendFriend**:
- Validates using social connections (mutual follows) as risk signal
- Supports LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk tiers based on connection count
- Justifies tracking social proximity metrics

### 2. Grameen Bank: Group Lending and Joint Liability

**Source**: "Grameen Bank Lending: Does Group Liability Matter?" (World Bank, Khandker)

**Key Findings**:
- Recovery rate: **98%**
- Group liability matters in both loan disbursement and repayment
- Women less of a credit risk than men
- Women's groups more homogeneous than men's groups
- Average loan size: $160
- Group lending increases repayment rates vs. individual lending

**Mechanism**:
- Individuals form groups of 5, receive financial training
- 2 members eligible first, monitored for 1 month
- If repaid within 50 weeks, other members qualify
- Joint liability: whole group liable for any member's default
- People pay due to **group pressure and self-respect**

**Application to LendFriend**:
- Validates social pressure as repayment mechanism
- Supports idea that accountability to network matters
- Justifies showing mutual connections to both parties

**Key Findings**:
- Large-scale field experiment on Kiva platform
- Joining a team increases lending in short window following intervention
- Team membership creates pressure to improve team's leaderboard ranking

## Behavioral Economics Theory (Foundational)

### 4. Reciprocity Theory: Indebtedness and Obligation

**Source**: "The psychological, computational, and neural foundations of indebtedness" (Nature Communications, 2023)

**Key Findings**:
- Receiving favors induces negative feeling of **"indebtedness"**
- Perceived intentions produce guilt and obligation
- Together these motivate reciprocity
- Delayed reciprocity creates temporary **"social debt"**
- Social debt doesn't need formal rules, just memory and recognition

**Source 2**: "Reciprocity as a Foundation of Financial Economics" (PMC, 2015)

**Key Findings**:
- Contemporary finance is "betting on the obligation of return"
- Reciprocity is the fundamental axiom of financial mathematics
- The ethical concept of reciprocity underlies all credit relationships
- Empirical evidence shows reciprocity is powerful determinant of behavior

**Application to LendFriend**:
- Supports hypothesis that larger loans create stronger obligation
- Validates social debt as repayment mechanism
- Justifies contribution weighting: $1000 favor > $10 favor

### 5. Loss Aversion: Stake Size and Social Capital

**Source**: Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) + Recent Extensions

**Key Findings**:
- Losses are psychologically **2x more powerful** than equivalent gains
- Loss aversion robust to stake size (coefficients 1.25-1.45)
- Recent research: **Loss aversion increases with stake size**
- Loss aversion extends beyond money to:
  - Time
  - Social status
  - Reputation
  - Sentimental possessions
  - Opportunities

**Application to LendFriend**:
- Supports hypothesis that larger defaults hurt reputation more
- Risk of losing social capital scales with amount borrowed
- $1000 default = 2x reputation loss vs. $500 default
- Validates contribution weighting hypothesis

**Citations**:

Decision under Risk. Econometrica, 47(2), 263-291.

## Contribution Weighting Hypothesis

### The Hypothesis

**Statement**: In P2P lending, the **combination** of social proximity AND contribution size creates stronger accountability than social proximity alone.

**Formula**:
```
Social Pressure = Σ(Proximity_i × Contribution_i) / Total_Funded

Where:
- Proximity_i = Social proximity score for lender i (0-100)
- Contribution_i = Amount lent by lender i
- Total_Funded = Total loan amount
```

**Example**:
```
Lender A: $800 (80%), proximity 90 → 0.80 × 90 = 72 points
Lender B: $150 (15%), proximity 50 → 0.15 × 50 = 7.5 points
Lender C: $50 (5%), proximity 20 → 0.05 × 20 = 1 point

Weighted Score: 72 + 7.5 + 1 = 80.5 → LOW RISK
```

### Supporting Evidence

**Direct Evidence**: None (untested in crypto P2P lending)

**Theoretical Support**:
1. ✅ Reciprocity theory: Larger favors → stronger obligation
2. ✅ Loss aversion: Reputation risk scales with stake size
3. ✅ Grameen Bank: Social pressure drives 98% repayment
4. ✅ Kiva: Loan size affects repayment performance

**What We Know**:
- ✅ Social connections matter (Kiva: 98.78% repayment)
- ✅ Loan size affects repayment (Kiva empirical finding)
- ✅ Reciprocity scales with favor size (Behavioral economics)
- ✅ Loss aversion scales with stake size (Prospect theory)

**What We Don't Know**:
- ❌ Does contribution amount × proximity predict repayment in crypto P2P?
- ❌ What is the optimal weighting formula?
- ❌ Does it work better than simple connection count?

### Validation Plan

**Phase 1 (Month 1-2)**: Track metrics without implementing
```typescript
track('loan_funded', {
  loanId: loan.id,
  lenderProximity: proximity?.riskTier,
  contributionAmount: contribution,
  percentOfLoan: (contribution / loan.principal) * 100,
});
```

**Phase 2 (Month 2-3)**: Analyze correlation
```sql
-- Do larger HIGH-proximity contributions correlate with repayment?
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN high_prox_percent > 70 THEN 'Mostly Close Network'
    WHEN high_prox_percent > 40 THEN 'Mixed Network'
    ELSE 'Mostly Strangers'
  END as funding_composition,
  COUNT(*) as loans,
  AVG(CASE WHEN defaulted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as default_rate
FROM loan_analysis
GROUP BY funding_composition;
```

**Expected Results** (if hypothesis is true):
- Mostly Close Network: 2-3% default rate
- Mixed Network: 7-10% default rate
- Mostly Strangers: 15-20% default rate

**Phase 3 (Month 3+)**: Implement if validated
- Only proceed if data shows >5% improvement
- Only if average loan has 10+ lenders
- Only if revenue justifies API costs ($500/mo)

## Additional Research Context

### Microfinance Social Capital

**Source**: "Social Collateral, Repayment Rates, and the Creation of Capital" (ScienceDirect, 2015)

**Key Findings**:
- Social capital (trust and network) used to encourage repayments
- Group pressure as supporting mechanism
- Training + social capital = high repayment rates

### Gender Effects in Microfinance

**Source**: Multiple studies (Kiva, Grameen, academic research)

**Consistent Finding**:
- Women have higher repayment rates than men
- Women's groups more homogeneous
- Women make more ambitious effort to repay

**Application**: Track gender in analytics (if available via Farcaster profiles)

## Research Gaps (Opportunities)

### What's Missing in Current Research

1. **Crypto-Native P2P Lending**:
   - Most research on traditional microfinance (Kiva, Grameen)
   - Limited research on blockchain-based lending
   - No research on Farcaster social graph for credit

2. **Contribution Amount Effects**:
   - Research shows social connections matter
   - Research shows loan size matters
   - **Gap**: Interaction effect untested

3. **Decentralized Social Networks**:
   - Research based on centralized platforms
   - Farcaster/Web3 dynamics may differ
   - On-chain transparency creates new dynamics

### LendFriend's Opportunity

**You can generate novel research** by:
1. Tracking default rates by social proximity tier
2. Analyzing contribution amount × proximity interaction
3. Publishing findings for Web3 community
4. Contributing to academic literature on decentralized finance

**Potential Paper**:
*"Social Proximity Scoring in Decentralized P2P Lending: Evidence from Farcaster"*
